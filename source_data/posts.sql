Even in the twilight I can see a vast emptiness in all directions, with only this thin ribbon of pavement cutting through to assure the traveler he is tethered to earth. In mid-day, the heat rises off these flats with an intensity that makes you think you''re in Hell''s furnace, and at midnight the Milky Way sweeps so close to the road that you think you''re on Heaven''s doorstep. But right now at twilight, there is just emptiness--an uncertain color in the uncertain light--and the highway slicing through on its way to nowhere\\r\\nI shift down and slip my Jaguar off the pavement, turning down the radio so I can hear the crunch of gravel and the engine, eager for its next command. I shift into neutral and put on the brake, but leave her engine running; I need to hear her rumbling purr when I''m out here alone. There is nothing here to see, but I step out of the car anyway, so I can get a better look. I lean against her and let her warmth slide seductively up my back and down my arms, like the massaging fingers of a lover.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nMan, there''s a lot of nothing out here--nothing as far as the eye can see.\\r\\nI light a cigarette and take a long drag.

I could have had a wife, a house, kids and vacations--I could have chosen wisely in my youth.

I could dare to change too, it''s not too late, the poison hasn''t finished me yet.\\r\\nI could change, I could.\\r\\nBut...\\r\\nI glance around again at the emptiness, averting my eyes from the offending star, and I draw one last, long drag on my cigarette before I crush it out on the pavement.

Not that it was meant to be a hard job anyway. Get in, wave the armor about, scare her into giving over what she didn''t really have; then out, down the street, in the pub necking back a pint or three by ten. But then he''d fallen upon her face; bright in the moonlight that splashed across the boards the squat wore in place of windows, where red and black graffiti fought in light and dark. He''d rapped hard on a board and shouted until she''d appeared behind what passed as a front door, trying to pull the heavy wood back, although it stuck, and stuck, and stuck. And each time it jarred, he''d made out a little more of her; her wide hazel eyes, her soft nose, her sad mouth. \\r\\nAs soon as he could get his arm in he''d pushed her, his hand hard on her shoulder, his fingers draping down her back.

Her room was badly lit, dirty; rubbish and clothes and syringes and candles and food defiling the floor around a stained blue mattress. He''d removed the heavy gun from his belt, pointed it, but she did nothing. Just stared, caught his eyes and held them. He''d shouted some more but the stare had continued, broken only by wetness in the depths of her eyes.

(45, 1, '2020-04-24 16:11:05', '2020-04-25 00:11:05', 'As I have grown older I have come to learn compassion is something to mature into and is not readily acquired. Compassion is cultivated like the pearl that comes from an oyster. The pearl is refined in the darken womb of the oyster over time, as compassion is empathy cultivated through the exercise of lived experiences that have been overshadowed by the power and intensity that has been shaped and purified by the fire of pain. It becomes the ultimate expansion and expression of unselfish love. It is also the outreach of personal growth where adept wisdom is brought forth from the intuitive self that sheds the light of heightened awareness that directly comes from the heart.\\r\\nI grew up in a family of three siblings. I am the youngest. My brother Michael is the eldest. He was born three months premature during the early fifties when prenatal care did not offer the advanced technologies that are available today in tending to premature births. During this time the oxygen provided to the incubator was not monitored or regulated. This resulted in permanent damage to the retina in both my brothers'' eyes causing Retrolental Fibroplasias, irreversible blindness, along with minimal brain damage. Being reared in a household with a handicap sibling placed a demand and imbalance upon not only my parents, but also my sister and myself.\\r\\n<!--more-->\\r\\nMy sister and I endured silently the underlying tensions of both parents who were struggling to care for the child with the most apparent needs. We were healthy and strong, we were not intentionally meant to go unnoticed. I was brought up in a deprived setting where physical and emotional needs went unmet and direct emotional availability was inconsistently provided. The adverse affects of emotional abandonment affected my emotional development. I learned to resent my brother from a very early age. I may not of been able to reason verbally or intellectually with what was going on around me but even at the tender age of three I understood what I was witnessing on a daily basis. His needs came before mine. I guess that is why at sixteen months of age I decided I had had enough and whacked my brother over the head with a sprinkler!\\r\\nI did not understand my brother''s handicap other than he could not see and even then, that did not sink in until I was in my adolescence. Growing up in the early sixties was still a time in which psychology and words like dysfunctional and co-dependence were unacknowledged topics. To consider explaining the nature of my brothers handicap to my sister and myself was not a consideration. The expectation I learned in my youth was to be self-reliant and independent. Unknowingly my resentment would eventually grow into deep bitterness and anger. My animosity would take me years to reconcile and integrate. Through a lot of therapy, self-understanding and eventual maturity, I would start to unravel the frostbite of my past and my attitudes that had hardened through the years.\\r\\nI have come to learn the very things I once most resented have become my greatest resource for learning from. My brother''s presence in my life has become a very strong, quiet mirror reflecting the twisted limitations I have learned to incorporate and surpass. I came to realize that my brother was a trapped participant in the family quandary just as much as I was. He was living with the handicap and literally blinded to any perceptible path in life other than what his senses had to offer as he developed as a person. I found a mindful opening the day I reached that understanding. It was a turning point for me. I was consciously crossing a bridge that offered another perspective only the birthing of empathy turned into compassion could bring. I was in my early twenties when I experienced this epiphany. The ironic irony was during this time I had been away at a monastery on a retreat in Pecos, New Mexico. I asked God to forgive me.\\r\\nLife weaves hidden messages within every situation. The task is deciphering the gift of those messages in-between the unread lines. When my brother lost his housekeeper a few years ago my mother asked me if I would help out on an interim basis until another housekeeper was found. I accepted the job since it would offer me extra pick up money. What was to be an intermittent period has become a long-term involvement, having to deal with my brother on a more continual basis over the past few years has allowed me the opportunity to come into a fuller relationship with him. I have come to learn the idiosyncrasy of his handicap, but I have also come to see the wonderful person that is eclipsed by the minimal brain damage and aspects of autistic traits. I have gained more tolerance from within myself in dealing with my brother one on one. I have my limitations and boundaries. I found the most honest way for me to be present and open to him without umbrage is to be with him when my heart is open and not closed. There are periods when I need to step back and be away from him.\\r\\nMy father recently suffered a severe and debilitating stroke. His stoke came like a pre-emptive hit without any warning. Striking him down literally while taking a shower I heard the thunderous noise that echoed down the hall out to the kitchen where I stood leaning against the counter, as my mother and I were casually conversing. Suddenly, without notice, the roles within the family are drastically shifted. My father''s role in Michael''s life was abruptly interrupted. My fathers for as long as I can remember has always gone out of his way in giving of himself to my brother. The term-dedicated father has been worn well by this man. Now the weekly care giving that had been established over a lifetime between father and son has been forever changed.\\r\\nIn life I have come to expect the unexpected. We are taught to live within pockets of comfort zones that truly, in the end, don''t exist. My greatest stability in life must come from within myself. In my father''s absence, I have taken over his role in attending to my brother. My mother early on was unavailable since her time and presence were wrapped up in care giving to my father during the initial months after his illness. Since the onset of my father''s stroke the incredible demand to shoulder the weight of changing responsibilities has been rudely transforming my heart whether I liked it or not. The awareness came to me recently that we can travel continually within ourselves to the heart of the mystery that each of us carries. No two blueprints of the soul are the same. Each is unique and precious like no other. The impact of living through challenging hardships this past year has stretched and opened me to depths and regions that have been quietly dormant. Losing my grandmother, being diagnosed with breast cancer, and my father''s stroke has propelled myself to opening the elusive trap door within my heart. The inner sanctum that lies within the greater, more obscure depths from within me. My sense of compassion for my brother has become a delicate two-edge sword. It has humbled me and taught me that life is very, very precious, and that nothing should ever be taken for granted. Resentment can still cut into me, reminding me like a good barometer, when I need my own space. Compassion is created by the harvest of a sound consciousness as it strives to understand the indifference, not just within the world, but also from within one''s self. Now I understand the term, \"My heart is full.\".', 'The Gift of Compassion by Jan Bianchi', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'the-gift-of-compassion-by-jan-bianchi', '', '', '2020-04-24 16:11:05', '2020-04-25 00:11:05', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/non-fiction/the-gift-of-compassion-by-jan-bianchi/', 0, 'post', '', 4),

He had been sitting there all day in front of the computer, pretending to do other things, putting off actually having to be creative. Which was strange considering, the thing he desired most was to be truly creative.\\r\\nThe problem wasn''t so much a lack of decent ideas and experience to draw from, but more the ability to cleanly extract just one of those ideas at a time. Perish the notion of actually organizing the cacophony of thoughts and images in his head into some sort of coherent story.\\r\\nHis thoughts were a very close-knit and protective herd.  If he managed to pluck one, it wasn''t long before the pack came to its rescue.  Once in a blue moon he was able to escape to the damp dark confines of his cave with one or two of the herds weaker thoughts firmly in his grasp.\\r\\nThen came the problem of how best to prepare these freshly bagged ideas.  Maybe it''s best to sink his teeth in to the raw fresh flesh, and quickly enjoy the guttural pleasures of the fresh kill.  He could slowly roast them over an open fire, so he could enjoy the warmth and taste nuances, which that method would provide.  Or, even better yet, he could preserve them; store the precious ideas for another day. Unfortunately, his struggle with the process - deciding what he will do with his newly acquired thoughts - often lasts well after the ideas have rotted away to nothing.\\r\\nOver-analysis was his stumbling block - well actually more of an Everest like mountain.  Of course plenty of people had scaled the sides of that mighty mountain, but he was quite certain that none of them were wearing sandals, cargo shorts, and a T-shirt at the time.  Every sentence, even every word for that matter, was scrutinized as though the fate of the world depended on its meaning.  If only he could equip himself to climb this gargantuan peak.\\r\\nThe correct tools seemed to be what he was lacking. Or maybe he had all the tools right there at his disposal but the prospect of figuring out how to correctly use them was proving to be too daunting of a task.  Either way, procrastination, and slacking seemed to be so much more pleasurable, at least until the bills starting rolling in, and reality was beating him about the face.\\r\\nBut, what is reality?  Aren''t writers in the business of helping people step out of reality, even if just for a moment?  A hiatus from reality isn''t found only in the fictitious world of a novel, it can be found in almost every bit of writing.  After all when you read the news of some far away place about something that is happening to people you don''t know, is that truly real?  Are you not, in a way taken, by your mind, to that place?  If you can''t see it, feel it, smell it, then how can it be real?  Hell, even things you can wrap your senses around don''t always feel real.  Does the nature - or rather the perception - of reality make the writer''s job easier or harder?  How can these questions even be asked in a world of uncertain realities?\\r\\nThese were all things that raced through his mind, as he enjoyed the sensory pleasure of picking at a scab on his arm.\\r\\nOh, what the hell!  He had just spent 5 minutes picking at a scab, that his fiance had been telling him to leave alone for weeks.  He always told her that he was certain, if he picked the scab, it would heal better.  He knew that was not true, at least not now that he was getting older.  But, it did give him a reason to not have to strain his brain trying to get those rambunctious thoughts all in a nice neat line.\\r\\nHe wondered if the problem wasn''t so much getting the thoughts out and on paper, but figuring out how to tie them all up with a pretty bow.\\r\\nHe thought it particularly fitting and even amusing that he couldn''t even get through a story about not being able to get through a story.\\r\\nWho ordered the irony? \\r\\nI need a smoke, Bob said to himself.\r\n', 'Thought Wrangling by Robert Bradeen', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'thought-wrangling-by-robert-bradeen', '', '', '2020-04-23 16:00:43', '2020-04-24 00:00:43', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=43', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(6, 1, '2020-07-29 20:41:25', '2020-07-30 04:41:25', 'They found the baby in the alleyway, next to the back door of Charlie''s. Everyone knows that the only time that door''s opened is when there''s a raid, or a fight, or both. So when the nurse - oh God, she had such tired eyes - so when she spoke on the TV, and said that it was just luck that there''d been anyone there, without even knowing about any of the fights, I told Charlie that it was better to think of the whole situation as fate, not luck.\\r\\nHe just turned around, glanced at the dusty TV above the cash register, squinted a little, and told me that he didn''t consider them things, and never did. He said that whether it was fate, or luck, that he''d ended up running this shit-hole of a bar, he didn''t care. He was just there and had to deal with it.\\r\\n\"Well, that''s fate,\" I said. \"Fate''s when things happen for a reason, despite what you do, despite what choices you make.\"\\r\\n\"Trust me, Father\" he said. \"If I''d made any choices in life, it wouldn''t have been standing here with you on a hot Wednesday afternoon, heaving around jugs of beer and a broom. Instead, I''d be... well, let''s just say I wouldn''t be here.\\r\\n\"And if I was you, I''d be careful who I started talking about fate with. Aren''t you all supposed to put it down to what the big fella wants? Or are you one of those young modern priests who doesn''t actually believe in God?\"\\r\\nHe said \"modern\" as if it was a swearword. I''m sure that if it weren''t his bar he would have spat on the floor as he said it. But instead he looked back from the TV to the bar floor and carried on sweeping.\\r\\nI suppose it could have been a miracle that the girl had been found. The only reason anyone had been in the alley was because a main had burst, forcing showers of water out onto the street in front of the bar. A crew had gone back behind Charlie''s with a backhoe to dig up the street, and they''d been down there about half-an-hour when a valve went, forcing them to shut the digger off. And that was when the foreman heard the gurglings of the baby.\\r\\nNow, don''t get me wrong, I''m certain in my faith. Well. I think I am. But I just can''t believe in a God who would put an innocent thing like that in such danger in the first place, at least for no reason. I''ve got to ask more of my God than that. My God is good.\\r\\nHe''s treated me well. There aren''t many other priests my age with a parish this size. Sure, I have a few problems here and there, but really, I''ve got nothing to complain about. Well, I didn''t until today. And now look at me.\\r\\nSo I sat at the bar and watched the TV flicker from the nurse to the water company foreman, a small dark-skinned man wearing a helmet a couple of sizes too big. They''d filmed him in the alley, and he was pointing from the big trench he''d dug, then over to Charlie''s back door. The camera followed his finger, as if a hole in the ground and a dirty door could explain the absurdity of a six-week old girl being left in an alleyway behind a dive bar.\\r\\nThen the story was done, and the anchor started talking about something else.\\r\\nI tilted my glass back, felt the foamy dregs hit the top of my lips, then placed the glass back on the bar, fitting the circle of the glass exactly within the edges of the round paper coaster. I like to do that. It reassures me when everything fits. And it''s important to me that people have their idiosyncrasies; probably why I felt so comfortable with Charlie, even if most the time he''s moaning about the bar. You know, he never says goodbye. Ever. He once told me, on one of the occasions when we managed to have a real conversation, that he hates to think of never seeing people again. He can''t bear that final goodbye, the thought that that moment could be the last time he ever saw someone. If he doesn''t acknowledge their exit, then to him they never really left. Which is a little bit weird, but it makes me like him. I don''t know why.\\r\\nAnd as I left, Charlie was rubbing his broom across the dirty floor in the far corner, trying his best to ignore me.\\r\\nWhich doesn''t really go to explain what I''m doing, six hours later, telling you about Sheila. But I have to start somewhere.\\r\\nAfter Charlie''s I went about my usual Wednesday, checking on Mrs. Hemingway at the corner, making sure that the dealers lurching around in front of the boarded-up store window weren''t giving her any trouble. They weren''t, for a change, even though a couple glared at me as I walked in. They don''t like me, and I don''t blame them. Not sure I liked them too much either. I certainly don''t now. I don''t think they see me as the priest. I mean, I''m not your typical small town Father am I? I''m not much older than they are. They''re used to a little old man they can pretend to respect. Someone they can say good morning to while they''re selling vials to kids. And that''s what they had until I got here. Well, that''s not me.\\r\\nWhen I asked Mrs. Hemingway, she said she was okay like she always did, even though the stress of owning the store could be seen running rivulets of worry across her face, carving deeper lines every time I saw her. She gave me a box of Tic-Tacs, the green ones that I liked to carry in the breast pocket of my coat, and asked God to bless me. Then I ducked out the door and crossed the street to the diner.\\r\\nAt that time of day, hours from lunch but not close enough to dinner, there''s never any problem getting my spot, the booth right in the middle of the restaurant directly overlooking Mrs. Hemingway''s store. As I tidied up my knife and fork, placing them equidistantly on the place mat, parallel to the table edge with my water glass directly above the knife, I looked over at the group across the street. They looked back. We played this game. I''d stare at them, and they''d stare at me. Nothing usually happened. Just games.\\r\\nSheila was serving coffee to Riley at the counter. I heard they had a thing once, but now their conversation was strained. She was scared of him. Most people in town are. They say he''s the reason the kids are there outside the store everyday, that they work for him. But it''s only talk, so he still gets away with acting like a normal citizen, still comes in for coffee everyday, usually at the same time as me. We barely say more than a \"hey\" to each other. He''s a big man, big both ways, with dirty hairy knuckles that swallow his coffee cup, and curly sideburns that never quite become a full beard. I can''t imagine the badness he''d done to Sheila. I think she''d been resigned to it.\\r\\nShe turned to grab the water jug, and walked from behind the counter to my booth. She has a gentle walk, a smooth way of putting one foot in front of the other that leaves her long face traveling along a single line in space. Makes me think of what she could have been if she''d had her chance, if men like Riley hadn''t taken her choices from her.\\r\\nAnd that was when the madness really started. With that walk. With me and Sheila. With me not thinking.\\r\\nShe started to pour the water, leaning over my table. \"Hear about that baby they found, Father?\" she asked, not quite managing a smile. Her eyes looked tired.\\r\\n\"Yes, I did Sheila. Nasty business.\" I looked at her face, lingered on her warm brown breasts that nestled in the open neck of her shirt, then down to my glass. I knew she knew I looked. I think she felt sorry for me, couldn''t understand why a good looking man like myself would have ever wanted to choose to renounce sex. So I think she allowed me a quick peek for the same reasons I take disabled kids to theme parks, to give them a snatch of something different, to make them feel as if they were living a normal life. And she''s right, of course.\\r\\n\"And how are you? He''s not bothering you is he?\" I nodded upwards at Riley.\\r\\n\"Him? God no.\" she glanced back at the counter and lowered her voice. \"But there is something I need to talk to you about. I was waiting for you to come in.\"\\r\\n\"What is it? Sit down, tell me,\" I said, pointing to the space opposite.\\r\\n\"I can''t now. It''s something I can''t tell you here. Give me ten minutes and I''ll meet you at my car out front. It''s the red Camaro,\" she said.\\r\\nThen she walked her walk back to Riley, who was looking agitatedly at his empty cup.\\r\\nSheila had often asked me advice before, and I was pleased to give it. Youngish, good-looking women don''t often sit for any length of time with priests, I''m sure you know that, and I was glad of the company. And, I have to admit, I looked forward to spending time with her. Even with her problems, she''s good company. And she''s very easy on the eye. It''s got to the point where I see her just about everyday; usually when I drop into the diner in the afternoon just before her shift ends or we sometimes run into each other at Charlie''s.\\r\\nWe typically talk about some man or another, or her landlord, or an argument with her sister. Sometimes I think she exaggerates her problems just so she can talk to me, because they''re often easily solved. I just sit with her a while, give her options and lead her to pick the right one. Or sometimes we just talk. But this was different. We usually speak in public where anyone can hear us. There isn''t anything odd in a priest giving a parishioner advice, even if I do look at her a little too closely.\\r\\nI took a sip of ice water, placed the glass square on the coaster and stood up.\\r\\n\"Not eatin'' today Father?\" Riley''s snippy voice cut across the diner. He must have known there was something up. I never come in then leave.\\r\\n\"No. No, not. Um, feeling too well.\" I was always bad at lying.\\r\\n\"Well you better run off home then, Father.\"\\r\\n\"Yes. I think I will.\"\\r\\n\"See ya then.\"\\r\\n\"Yeah, I''ll see you later.\" He was only trying to make it worse for me. I wondered if he was the problem Sheila wanted to talk to me about. I hoped not.\\r\\nSheila''s car was parked over to the right of the lot, an old red Camaro, like she said, with dents and rust and dirty smears over its windscreen. The sort of car you''d expect a waitress to drive. I leant on the passenger side door while I waited, eyeing the dealers across the road. They were there again and again, day after day, the same five kids just standing, looking angry, swapping stares with me. They knew we were playing a game as much as I did, but they enjoyed it a lot more. I thought about what was going through their minds, if they ever got bored, if they felt it was worth it, if they were ever scared, like I was.\\r\\nShe came out of the diner almost running, defiling the gracefulness of her walk with an awkward shuffle, and motioned with her head to the car.\\r\\n\"Get in. It''s open.\"\\r\\nI pulled open the door and slid inside.\\r\\nShe drove us out, past the strip mall, past the last gas station for forty miles, out into the plain where the road disappears in the haze, then turned and parked behind a billboard for a new housing development. It was getting hotter, one of those strange days when the heat suddenly kicks up a notch around four, and I could feel moisture begin to drip from my forehead. But I think I would have been sweating anyway.\\r\\nThe silence was wrong. There are usually other people around us when we meet, and to be alone together was disjointed, uncomfortable. I wanted to tell her that she was in a safe place, that I''d protect her whatever her problem, but I couldn''t. I sat there looking out into the open space like a pimply teenager on a date, wringing my fingers. And I could tell that she was struggling as much as I was, because she couldn''t look my way. Just hard silence between us. The seconds ticked away to the sound of popping metal, as some parts of the car cooled while others warmed in the sun.\\r\\nEventually she spoke.\\r\\n\"I''m sorry I brought you out here, Father.\"\\r\\nIt was a relief to hear her voice.\\r\\n\"That''s OK, Sheila. Tell me what''s on your mind,\" I said.\\r\\n\"It doesn''t matter. You can''t help. Don''t worry. I''ll just take you back to town. Forget about it.\" She went to turn the key in the ignition, and I leaned over to hold her hand still, to pull the key back.\\r\\nNow we were close. \"There is obviously something troubling you.\" I said, my face no more than six inches away from her nose. My hand remained on hers. \"You didn''t bring me all this way for something unimportant. Let me help you. Let me know what''s wrong.\"\\r\\n\"I''m sorry.\" she said, her green-brown eyes finally pinned on mine. \"I was wrong to ask you here. You don''t need to get involved in this. It could be bad for us. I mean, you.\"\\r\\nI removed my hand and sat back in the seat. A breeze gusted through the open window, and it felt good, fresh.\\r\\nI spoke without looking at her, ''Sheila, you have to remember that this is what I do. that I''m here to help you. It doesn''t matter how I feel, or what happens to me.\"\\r\\nI didn''t believe what I was saying either.\\r\\n\"So just let me know what you brought me out here for.\" It could have been someone else speaking.\\r\\n\"I was pregnant Father.\"\\r\\n\"I see,\" I said, still not looking back at her. \"What happened?\"\\r\\nShe turned.\\r\\n\"I got rid of it.\"\\r\\n\"Oh.\" A dribble of moisture fell across my forehead, working it''s way down my nose. I wiped my eyes with my sleeve. More silence swept through the car, as I put my broken thoughts together. The heat was getting unbearable.\\r\\n\"Are you OK? I mean, that''s what''s important. How are you?\" We were looking directly at each other now, across the seat divider, across the gearshift.\\r\\nA tear formed slowly in the cusp of her eye, a tiny bubble of pain beading against the thick mascara. \"I thought I was OK, that I''d manage. Then there was that little girl who was found. It brought it all back. I couldn''t sleep last night, I was laying in bed, sweating, thinking about what I did, about how the girl could have been mine, about how she''d be starting to walk now, how I''d be looking after her, feeding her, buying her clothes, making her pretty.\" her voice broke down into a dark cloud of sobs.\\r\\nI put my arm over her back, brought her close to me. Her soft hair caressed my chin, which I rested on the top of her head. She shook with tears.\\r\\n\"What''s done is done.\" I said, staring out into the plain.\\r\\nI was searching for guidance, for someone or something - the emptiness of the countryside, the far off blank horizon, the baked yellow grass yearning for a breeze - anything that wasn''t in the car to give me permission to fall into her, to drown myself in her warm hair, her slight body, her gentle breaths.\\r\\nBut I was lost. There was the rational part of me, the part that gets me through my life, the un-thinking right and wrong black and white good and bad just do it machine that wanted to be able to give her the same advice I''d give to anyone else, and then leave, let her deal with her own problems. Help with loving detachment. But I was there, holding her in the hot car, feeling the part of me that really makes me who I am, the part that supports my faith and informs my wonder, the parts that supplies my awe - the real God''s honest man - I was feeling that part of me trickling through my thoughts, just like my blood, and I realized how much I cared for her. How much I wanted her not to hurt. How much I really wanted her.\\r\\nShe cried some more, and spoke into my chest.\\r\\n\"I felt so worthless. So pathetic. So evil. I knew what that poor girl was going through when she left the baby there. How frightened she must have been, how terrified I was. How terrified I still am. And I lay there in my shitty little apartment, alone on my big bed as the walls just loomed in on me knowing that it can''t happen again, that I don''t want to be alone. That I need someone, someone good.\"\\r\\nShe drew away from me a little, her arms remaining close on mine, her eyes pinning me down in the seat.\\r\\n\"I don''t want to be alone, Father. Ever. I can''t stand another night like that again. I can''t go through my days trying to make the best of it, putting up, making do. Taking shit from assholes like Riley. I need someone. I need you. I''m in love with you, Father.\"\\r\\nEven though I knew what she was going to say, even though I wanted her to say it, the words still hit me hard. But I''m glad she said it first.\\r\\n\"We all need someone to love.\" I said. The words came out like a whisper in the dark.\\r\\nThe internal battle still rang through my body. I didn''t know what to say to her. Of course I wanted to tell her my truth, to let her know how much I wanted her, but I had so much to lose.\\r\\n\"You know that the Church is my life,\" I told her. \"I''ve made a commitment... I''d lose everything I''ve worked for. Everything I believe in. You know I care about you. And if things were different, if I''d made different choices. But...\"\\r\\nShe pushed her face into my neck. I could feel the tears cool against my skin, mingling with my sweat. My face remained staring out of the windscreen, as if I was another person.\\r\\n\"Some choices are too important to be thought about\" she said.\\r\\nMinutes stretched by, and I tried not to think, tried to clear my mind. Then I kissed the top of her head, keeping my face in her hair. She pulled away, and looked up, and our lips touched. Slowly.\\r\\nAnd slowly we sat there, and sat there, and kissed. And it was good.\\r\\nShe drove us back to town as the sun was falling. The buildings were glowing in golden shadows, darkness chasing light out into the street. We didn''t speak, and she left me in the diner parking lot, where we started. I was alone.\\r\\nThe dealers were in their roost, leaning and spitting and swearing. They saw me, and we stood together and apart, me watching them watching me, as the sun sank lower behind the diner, as I wondered what I was, as I struggled to move, as I struggled to leave.\\r\\nWatching, thinking, waiting for what would happen next.\\r\\nThen I stepped off the curb.\\r\\nThe first dealer''s punch hit me on my left temple, and I managed to ride it, but his second one smashed my chin and left me dazed. Then another hit me again and then kicked me, and I went down, and then all five of them were there, kicking and kicking and kicking and laughing and snorting with exertion. Then they left me and it grew dark.\\r\\nI woke again to the neon lights from Mrs. Hemingway''s store flickering over my blood on the sidewalk. Somehow I managed to stand and limp back to the church.\\r\\nAnd that''s when I found you here, Father, and asked you to hear my confession. I am here, and I confess. I have sinned.\r\n', 'Not Waving Goodbye, Saying Hello by Martin Bell', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'not-waving-goodbye-saying-hello-by-martin-bell', '', '', '2020-07-29 20:41:25', '2020-07-30 04:41:25', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=6', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Her hair, stirring in the wind, runs over her bare shoulders. I want to put my arm around her but that’s not how we are. Perhaps I would if we were boyfriend-girlfriend, not best friends.\\r\\nThe full moon makes Jordan appear washed-out, her blonde hair a shocking shade of white. Her cheekbones seem to jut out worse than usual, giving her a skeletal fashion. I know I look just as bad - nobody looks good at night.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n‘How was your day?’ she asks, giving me a furtive glance before going back to her cigarette. The smoke appears to be a blue-grey mist that winds away from her frail hand and twirls up to the stars.\\r\\nI drop my gaze to my lap. ‘Doesn’t matter,’ I murmur, wrapping my battered arms around myself. It’s cold out tonight.\\r\\nJordan doesn’t respond, just meekly tucks a stray chunk of hair behind one ear. Out of the corner of my eye I can see the purple welt on her temple. It looks fresh; she probably got it just this morning, coupled with others. We don’t talk about those things.\\r\\nShe finishes her cigarette and flicks one slender wrist, tossing the butt over her shoulder, over the edge. Her favorite bracelet, beads of green that match her eyes, jangles timidly. It was my fourteenth birthday present to her.\\r\\n‘Listen,’ she crawls over to me and presses a finger to the corner of my mouth, next to a faded scar.\\r\\nWe’re silent, straining to hear the cars rumble by, more than a dozen stories below. She informs me she heard it, her large eyes blinking slowly.\\r\\nIt was a game we used to play while our fathers were sleeping off their hangovers; throwing things off the building and estimating how long it would take to hit the ground and pretending we could hear them. Jordan always heard the splat before I did. Childish, but it stuck with us. Everyone remembers the most unimportant things in his or her childhood.\\r\\nJordan straightens from her crouch; late-night moisture clings to her flimsy shirt. She brushes dirt off her pants and walks over to our potted plants, twenty or so, resting on an old card table. At an apartment with God-knows-how-many people, it’s surprising there are just a few who venture out to the roof. Jordan and I''ve planted flowers every spring since we were eleven and never have much trouble keeping them alive. No one destroys them.\\r\\n‘Too bad there’ll be no flowers next year...’ Jordan pushes her finger into the dark soil filling the cheap plastic. ‘They’re kind of pretty.’ She plucks the flower from its stem. A small petal floats to her palm and she brings it close to her face to blow away. She sets about removing the other petals.\\r\\nSeeing my friend destroy something we’d done together makes me feel slightly nauseous. I realize I soon have to tell her I’m backing out of our plan. She catches me fidgeting with my jacket zipper. Our eyes meet and my hands pause, mid-zip. My fingers are freezing on the metal. She studies my face.\\r\\n‘You asshole,’ she whispers, her face crumpling. She drops the remaining bit of blossom. ‘You said we’d go together.’\\r\\nI twist around and peek over the edge of the building, to the masses of life below. ‘I just can’t... when --’ I pause to think. ‘We’re going about this the wrong way, Jordan. Why don’t we just run away?’\\r\\n‘Because that doesn’t end anything, Paul!’ she cries.\\r\\nI turn back to her. ‘Yeah, and this doesn’t solve anything!’\\r\\n‘Don’t tell me you’d rather keep living like this, Daddy’s little play-thing? You enjoy it?’\\r\\nHer words strike me but I silently forgive her; she’s angry and doesn’t want me to know she understands. But she does.\\r\\nI remain calm. ‘You think I enjoy my father...'' Refusing to let the words form on my lips, I continue. ''I don’t like it any more than you do.’ She flinches, her hand raising to her bruised temple. ‘We could call someone...’\\r\\nJordan’s eyes narrow to slits. ‘Been through this part, Paul. I refuse to be a runaway or foster child. Neither has a good life. This is bad enough; I don’t want it any worse. I’m going...’ her voice lowers and her face softens. ‘And if you’re not coming --’ She fumbles with the catch on her bracelet, steps towards me and clasps it on my wrist.\\r\\nI can feel the much-expected tears well up but I blink them away. ‘I just can’t. I’m going to call someone for myself... tonight. I’d rather be a foster kid.’\\r\\nJordan doesn’t speak so I plunge ahead. ‘You knew all along that I’d back out,’ I say.\\r\\nShe nods. ‘Yeah. I did.’ She stuffs her hands into her faded blue-jeans pockets and strides back over to the ledge. She’s shivering again. Or is it still? I didn’t notice if she had stopped. One sneakered foot raises up, then the other.\\r\\nShe doesn’t hesitate and I don’t wait around. This isn’t a game; I know I’ll hear something hit the pavement. I fling open the heavy steel door to the apartment’s dim interior, dash inside, down the stairs, more stairs. By the time I reach the frigid outdoors, there’s a crowd gathering. I push my way through, lungs feeling as though they’ll burst.\\r\\nSweat drips down my forehead, clings to my upper lip and I raise a hand to wipe it away. Jordan''s bracelet slides along my wrist. I remain fixed to the spot, practically boring a hole into her head before heading to the phone-booth down the street.\\r\\nAll I can think is I was wrong.

The torn utensil package lies caul-like, contorted on the metal tray. The white walls are saturated with the charred smell of old drilling.\\r\\nShe peppers her story with warnings like \"Not flossing when you brush is like not washing your armpits when you shower\" while clamping my tongue down with a nickel-sized mirror and grazing a pick along my gum line in deft arcs. Electric red wires splay from the corners of her eyes. I think she is smiling under that mask.\\r\\nI want to tell her that the orange cheese puffs and the flat root beer and the chocolate snack cakes, that the honeymoon at the Grand Canyon and the sex on the backyard hammock and the long margarita conversations-that none of it lasts; that the gel one day strains into a few elastic strings between you both, which snap into fewer and fewer each time he leaves in the morning to repair another refrigerator or washing machine. But I can only respond in gurgles and teethe at the instruments.\\r\\nShe rests the base of her hand hard on the bridge of my nose and hums with the buffer. In the eclipse, I can make out the double-bump of two gold bands. A mossy green fleck flies onto her mask, dangles, then falls to my paper bib. She doesn''t understand how slow a demise can be, how imperceptible-from going out for pizza on the third anniversary to ordering Chinese delivery on the fourth. I would choke on spearmint saliva trying to explain.\\r\\nAs I peel away from the plastic armrest covers to rinse, the hygienist wheels backwards on the cushioned stool until she bumps the supply cabinet. She hands me a new toothbrush, throat culture pink with a small head and soft crew cut bristles, and a pamphlet detailing the proper brush jiggle-action. I run my tongue over my teeth, knowing this is as smooth as it gets.\\r\\n---\\r\\nThose first mornings, my gums taste metallic. My orange juice stings. Crumbs stab into my elbows; their shadows stretch across the vinyl tablecloth, revealing them in clusters. Between him and me are the sports section and his slice of cold pizza. I cringe at another sip.\\r\\nHe gives me a prolonged look over the top of his shield and then turns the page, wafting his woody-spicy cologne my way. It burns my lungs and makes me a warped sort of hungry.\\r\\n\"I''m brushing,\" I explain.\\r\\nEverything in our bedroom-the maroon shag, the itchy mauve quilt, the ribbed taupe curtains-exudes that woody-spicy stink. The wet dog smell from the clothesbasket on the closet floor adds even more bite to the pungent aroma of the room. Only the antique bureau, swelling out like a baroque museum piece with claw feet and teardrop knobs, is able to protect my socks and bras and sweatpants from absorbing it all.\\r\\n\"What, your hygienist been threatening you?\"\\r\\nWe promised each other we''d never lose the drive--that we''d move cross-country to California and sell T-shirts and surf boards in a little shop on the beach--that we''d never come back. I always think maybe if we leave right now we could still escape. He would lose the weight and his hair would grow in the right places again and his eyes would open as wide as they used to; I''d sleep less and drink more and touch things again with the tips of my fingers.\\r\\nHe downs his coffee and heads off early to work. When the kitchen air clears, that familiar kitty litter odor returns-even though we have no cat. I wash last night''s dishes, watch carved-off bits of chicken fat and overripe broccoli heads swim in slow-motion rewind to the drain as if they were meant to be there all along, then go to work myself.\\r\\n---\\r\\nWith the afterimage of the computer screen burnt into my retinas, my voice strained from the customer service falsetto, and a point on the left side of my skull, behind the ear, throbbing from the too-tight headset, I drive to the pharmacy. It smells pleasantly sterile and the carpets are gray. There are rows of floss, pre- and post-rinses, picks and pokers. I choose a little of everything and continue home.\\r\\nThe TV projects varying hues, sad and happy, across the living room. Despite that, his boxer-briefs and wife beater and bowl of stale popcorn bathe in an eerily constant blue. He is stubbled and his eyes are scuffed beads.\\r\\nI go to the bathroom and whisk the shower curtain closed; I''d rather see the shadows of soap scum on the liner than the paint peeling on the shower windowsill or the torn shade or the dingy traction mat. I tape my pamphlet to the mirror and spend the night learning to use everything. I ignore the tiny square tiles all over the floor and the walls so I don''t get caught up in their complicated patterns. I pretend I can''t smell his Garden Fresh disinfectant spray hanging in the air, though I sneeze every few minutes anyway. By midnight, my gums ache and all I can taste is strong mint mixed with traces of blood. I am done.\\r\\nWhen I go to bed he is lying on his back: still awake. I try to change my clothes, but I can''t find the right drawer--every teardrop feels the same--and I decide not to bother. I stub my toe on the bedpost, and the pain swells back on me as I crawl in. He turns his head and says, \"My brother once got on some brushing kick. Brushed off all his enamel. Fourteen cavities.\" Then he thumps over onto his side, having made his point, and I know he''s asleep when his breathing turns light, steady--like a child''s.\\r\\nI''m thankful we never installed that mirror on the ceiling like we dreamed we would while we were dating--while we were kissing under feathered down and tangled in each other''s arms, when we would tumble into bed from any side and sleep wherever we landed--so I don''t have to see us now, tranquil as corpses in the sallow morning light, and I''ll never wake to witness myself gripping the edge of the mattress after I''ve tripped down that fjord in my nightmares, my body tensing and my face twisted as if I''m still about to plunge into those icy Nordic waters.\\r\\n---\\r\\nIn the morning, my mouth feels coated with dirt. Orange juice is acid on an open wound. But over the next nights, the red trails against the white sink fade to pink and then to clear. He is awake when I come to bed, but his remarks wither to huffs, then to heavy sighs.\\r\\nAs I wait him out, I think about how we used to laugh at couples that look like we do now.\\r\\nI remember how, amidst the scent of gardenias and the endless Canon in D of our wedding day, he seemed to let out one long breath--how his tuxedo, the one he wore when he proposed over that dinner of swordfish in light lemon crème, began to crease in rays of strain at the buttons to form a column of dark comets--and how fast it happened--sometime after the vows, perhaps around the time his mother unveiled four pans of coffee cake in a curious substitution for the frosted three-tier double mocha I''d expected, or as late as when we dragged ourselves across the sticky summer leather of the limousine for that final ride to the airport.\\r\\nI try to picture him young, but the wispy hologram is a film so thin it pops with the slightest pressure--a movement, a breath. I try to fantasize about leaving him, about being left by him, about us agreeing with a handshake to leave each other, but it stops there. I can''t dream up a life to follow.\\r\\nHe comes home late holding a portable, wind-up clock. The hands have phosphorescent strips and the sticker on the face is creased into a liquid-looking line that meanders from the II to the VII.\\r\\n\"What''s that for?\"\\r\\n\"The bathroom.\"\\r\\n\"Why?\"\\r\\n\"Time my showers.\" He has never taken a shower more than seven minutes long. \"I''ll just put it here,\" on the middle shelf of the wicker wall rack, atop a stack of navy face cloths. He sprays his disinfectant and its fierce Garden Freshness sends me into a sneezing fit.\\r\\nI do end up creating some uses for the clock. Countdown starts the moment I hear him drag his feet down the hallway, over the pharmacy-gray industrial carpeting, past the bathroom and into the bedroom. While time runs, I do other things: wash my face, brush my hair. I overlook the navy blue lint on the rim of the tub, the grime behind the toilet, the lush mold inside the sink''s flood hole. Forty-two minutes later, he is undoubtedly asleep--limp on the mattress.\\r\\nThen, I can begin:\\r\\nFirst, I rinse with a mildly minty plaque-loosener (2 minutes); next, I brush teeth, tongue, gums, lips--everywhere--with baking soda toothpaste (26 minutes); then I floss, twenty-three strokes per gap: ten against each tooth, three sweeping the gum in between (19 minutes); and last, I gargle with a mouthwash that makes my eyes tear, my face burn-so strong in my throat it blocks out the Garden Fresh stench (2 minutes).\\r\\nI grow more accustomed to the bedroom darkness, learning to count my steps to the bureau, to feel for nicks in the wood, to find pajamas by the texture of the fabrics. Soon, I undress and dress and maneuver as though I never needed eyes at all.\\r\\n---\\r\\nHe eats leftover meatloaf slathered in ketchup for breakfast. His temples have seemed to swell and stretch and merge under the skin on his forehead, and the lump rises and falls when he chews; he resembles a feeding gorilla.\\r\\nThough groggy, I try to remember if my change happened before or after his--whether I was the cause or the effect.\\r\\nWhile I rummage for the milk, I notice a pair of never-used pomegranate candles, in block-crystal bases, buried in the nook between the fridge and the breadbox. I used to wear red like that on my lips--that same bright shade. I could never wear it now, knowing how easily lipstick stains--but I wonder what I''d look like. I wonder how pomegranate floss would taste.\\r\\nBefore I add milk to my raisin bran, I pick out the raisins--knowing how readily they catch between the teeth--and they sit like a deposit of frosted rabbit pellets on my napkin. Since I began waking up before him to gargle, my appetite has returned--the mouthwash mint is intense enough to temper his cologne, though not enough to smother it. The metal spoon resting on my middle finger cools the spot where my skin is starting to dry and peel from the floss.\\r\\n---\\r\\nAt 1:34 a.m., he knocks. I freeze.\\r\\nI open the door. He is sitting the wrong way on a kitchen chair--straddling it, leaning forward against its back-facing the bathroom door. I never even heard him out there.\\r\\n\"Do you have to use the bathroom?\"\\r\\nHe glares at me. \"Yeah.\" There is a blanched sliver of food between his front teeth.\\r\\n\"Here. Use it.\" I step out. The floss is cutting off blood flow to the tips of my middle fingers.\\r\\n\"After you.\" The food is still there, harbored in that crevice.\\r\\nI step back in. \"You''re just gonna sit there and watch me?\"\\r\\n\"Yeah.\" He wouldn''t bother to get rid of it even if I told him it was there.\\r\\nWe stare at each other. His face and neck are blackened with bristly hair. Weak pulses of blood magnify into painful throbs at my purple fingertips. His thighs bulge off the edge of the seat.\\r\\nIn a flash I grab the knob, and before he can heave himself up and jam his swollen slippered foot in the gap, I have it locked. He slams into the door, somewhere up high--with his fists, or his elbows, or his entire lower arm--and the sound fills the bathroom, resonating in the ceramics.\\r\\nRight away I release the chokehold and soothe my fingers under cool water. I hear the chair bruise the walls as he lugs it back to the kitchen, then his slipper tread rasp against the rug in weary steps through the hallway toward the bedroom... then no noise, and I am safe.\\r\\nAfter my fingers recover, I finish flossing-and I add extra strokes, just to be sure. Then I brush again, massaging every flesh surface, stripping away anything dead I may have left the first time. The mirror reflects a flush, clear-eyed face; my lips seem fuller, darker.\\r\\nWhen I go to the bedroom, I take time to appreciate the scratched wood, the sad cold knobs, the weaves of the fabric. While I''m exposed in the dark, I take time to stretch, to knead, to memorize the softness of my skin.\\r\\n---\\r\\nI''m flossing between the top left canine and lateral incisor when I spot a single stubble hair in the sink-not quite a centimeter long. I run the water, but it won''t wash down. I use the blunt end of my brush. Then the bristled end of his. My fingernail finally does the trick. I clean my finger with antibacterial hand soap, then I clean the sink with a wad of toilet paper. Then I dry my hands, and I look around.\\r\\nThe first thing to go is the Garden Fresh disinfectant spray. Hoping to neutralize any lurking hint of it, I wrap Gardenia potpourri in gauze and hang it everywhere: the doorknob, the window lock, the sink drainpipes. I replace everything navy--the face cloths, the bath towels, the shaggy rug, the fuzzy toilet seat cover--with white lint-free things never drenched in Garden Freshness. I cut the curtain liner down and tear away the traction mat-the suction sounds like packing bubbles popping. I scour the tiles on the walls and floor with lemony-pine cleaners. With a mixture of bleach and baking soda, I polish the tub, then the toilet, then the sink; I add some to the bristles when I use his brush to scrub inside the flood hole.\\r\\nWhen I step into the tub to toss out the torn shade and re-paint the flaking sill, I notice the moon, high up and pale as bone. I open the window. The cool night air falls in, and trees rustle outside. I discover that if I stand here in the tub, and it''s past a certain hour, I can always see the moon--so every night I open the window to wait for it.\\r\\n---\\r\\nWhenever the clothesbasket overflows, whenever he drapes his belts over the back of the recliner, whenever he spills beer on the living room Oriental, whenever he brands the light switch with grease-prints--I leave things as they are. The distinct odors of the house worsen as neglected rooms surrender and deteriorate, but my bathroom stays pristine.\\r\\nI walk on the cold bathroom tiles barefoot now, and my dreams take me to the bathhouses of ancient Pompeii instead of the Norwegian Sea. When I crouch to study the festive mesh of green mint and red cinnamon floss at the top of the trash, I catch myself humming carols the next morning. The curled-up toothpaste tube begins to remind me of a young ballerina on her tummy, stretching her toes to her head.\\r\\nSometimes I floss leaning against the newly satin-finished sill, and I tell the moon that I was once a dancer-that when I was seven, I would pirouette for hours--I would sleep in my tutu. Then I extend my arms through the window, as I once would have in third arabesque, to floss between the moon and the sky--to scrape away the parched, ancient craters--and again I can imagine myself a prima ballerina princess.\\r\\nAnd only very late at night, when the trees have quieted and the door is locked and the window is open wide, the moon talks back to me. It tells me how dizzy it gets, how it questions its purpose.\\r\\n---\\r\\nA sudden snap.\\r\\nThe roller keeps spinning, and the last of the white unwaxed floss--about five inches--droops from my fist. It was my last reel, my spare.\\r\\nI have no choice. I gargle, shut the window, and leave the bathroom. The neighbors'' driveway light streams through the Venetian blinds in the bedroom like so many suns, a prison stripe spotlight for me as I tiptoe in.\\r\\nHe is on his back. I undress and dress awkwardly, shrinking away from the bright bands, thinking that he could see me exposed at any moment--but he does not sit up, does not open his eyes. I sneak into bed, stare at the ceiling and wait.\\r\\nI listen to the irregular rhythm of his breathing, but it never steadies, never strengthens. Other than that, the room is black and silent. I can feel the threads of cotton on the back of my arms and neck.\\r\\nThe light in the neighbors'' driveway clicks off. In the void above I catch glimpses of the ghosts of the veins inside and behind my eyes, cast in strange pulsing yellows that move with me no matter where I look.\\r\\nI close my eyes, turn to my side and try to force sleep. Despite the mint in my throat and on my tongue, I smell his cologne deep in the fibers of my pillow, where it will seep into my skin overnight. I hear my own blood coursing in spurts through my ears. The bed seems both incalculably large and small. My teeth are slick against my tongue, but I know gritty sugars linger in places I never reached. Before long, bacteria will consume the sugars and produce acids, then the acids will sear the soft tissue at my gumline, dissolve the minerals in my enamel, dig further for the dentin, then the pulp...\\r\\nHe rolls toward me. It takes him years. \"What''s the problem?\"\\r\\n\"Ran out of floss. Can''t finish.\"\\r\\nHe lets out a long breath--so long I think he might deflate. \"So go and get more.\" He eases himself back over, no thumping or huffing. His breathing becomes shallow and regular within seconds.\\r\\nNow that it''s dark I can dress quickly, counting nicks and knobs, sorting through piles of familiar materials, pulling things on and over, zipping up and buttoning down. I smile as I go, admiring my own adeptness. I find his wallet in the pants on top of the dirty clothes mound, which is waist-high and spilling three feet out from the closet.\\r\\nThe night air has made the car door handle cold. I pull out, shivering with the moon by my shoulder but expecting the sun on my back soon enough. I don''t worry about leaving my toothbrush behind. I''ll buy a new one in San Diego.', 'Scraping Craters by Nancy Callahan', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'scraping-craters-by-nancy-callahan', '', '', '2020-08-02 21:59:47', '2020-08-03 05:59:47', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=10', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The experience of having gone through a mastectomy and breast reconstruction shaped me in ways that would change my life forever more. My heart fell into a free fall much like an autumn leaf that is released from the branch it had grown upon after my initial diagnosis. The leaf descends to the ground graciously and without much effort. My heart''s perspective twirled and changed colors in its descent moving more deeply into my true heart where the deepest gift of heart lives resoundingly by the strong presence of my tenacious spirit. I discovered many inner treasures yet to be revealed. The two-fold passage of having breast cancer affected me both physically and spiritually. My spiritual journey became part of my healing in the aftermath of my physical recovery.\\r\\nI would spend well over a year healing from my breast reconstruction surgery. During this time I continued working on my journal I had been keeping since my diagnosis. I found myself settling into the experience as time gradually progressed over the ensuing months. I could sense my vulnerable edges still, but as I wrote the pages in my journal about the tumultuous time of dealing with breast cancer, it also lent to me a rite of passage to go more deeply within and to grapple the reins to not only my heart but the true defining force of my life giving spirit. The entries I wrote became my voice in finding the strength of my spirit. And yes, I did run the emotional gamut of disbelief, anger, denial, sadness and eventual heartfelt acceptance that anyone encounters when diagnosed with any type of illness.\\r\\nThe journey of breast cancer becomes a reckoning between the self and the soul. My sensation of spirit became my fortitude and hope. I could sense the presence of my soul more keenly as my heart opened into the unspoken calm of my vast spiritual ocean that awaited me. Calling me home to look inside and drift within and feel the various tides ebbing and flowing as I weighed the emotional ups and downs as I progressed on my voyage with cancer. My greatest revelation was to become my thanks for having breast cancer. For had I not withstood the anxiety and fears, alongside the hope and faith of unforeseen circumstances, I would not come to see the gift I was learning from it. We are taught to fear cancer and that it is something that does not promote positive change. In the end, it is the leverage that is creating the need for change itself.', 'Thanks to my Cancer by Jan Bianchi', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'thanks-to-my-cancer-by-jan-bianchi', '', '', '2020-05-03 19:02:20', '2020-05-04 03:02:20', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/non-fiction/thanks-to-my-cancer-by-jan-bianchi/', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(12, 1, '2020-08-04 22:33:02', '2020-08-05 06:33:02', 'The first day I saw him, others were ignoring him and, perhaps, the rest of the world meant little to him at this point. Certainly this part of the world, a bus stop near a doughnut-and-coffee place, its walls sticky red in the sun, with its pool tables and Pacheco. It was where T.V judges passing sentence inaudibly in the background made sense. In front, trucks roared by and grit lay in little heaps at the side of the road. There was nothing for the eye to rest on, and therefore, few places for the mind to find peace.\\r\\nThe man was talking to himself, or perhaps, to someone I couldn’t see. I couldn’t make out the language, perhaps it was Bengali, or another Indian language, in which he was seemingly explaining himself, going through lists, and spitting. Little dry spits like a boy who has just discovered how to and keeps doing it to try to be a man, except he was a man, and had gray hair.\\r\\nNo one else seemed interested. Waiting for the bus was enough. Meanwhile, I watched. The man was middle aged, comfortably dressed in clean casual clothes, and occasionally he ran his fingers quickly through his hair, as if his scalp was crawling. He kept up a steady stream of talk that, whether he intended it or no, kept everyone at bay. He cast his eyes from side to side, and catching a glimpse of them I saw they were sad and tired, rather than crazed, and there were great distances in them. The hand passed through the hair again, and I could see the nails were slightly long but clean, so he cared for himself, or had others who would do so, perhaps family members moved by compassion, hoping to do all they could for this man.\\r\\nWhat had brought him to this place from the distant land of his ancestors? Was it just curiosity, or love, or work which led him here only for him to find it slipping from him, causing this retreat behind a wall of soft, rapid murmuring? The harsh Californian light was directly overhead, making shadows shrink and picking out all the grit and rubbish underfoot. The lines in every face at the bus stop were visible and deep.\\r\\nWas he in hell, or was he seeking a sweet place, as we all stood waiting for the number 19 bus. I pictured buses as they moved along country roads in India, kicking up dust and passing cars spattered with colored powder from the Holi celebrations. In a crossroads schoolhouse, seen as if through a thick wall of glass, an aging teacher stood by a blackboard covered in formulae, a beam of light illuminating tiny swirls of dust that continued in their orbits in front of his spotless white shirt. “Well…?” and the teacher leaned forward for an answer.\\r\\nThe bus arrived, and we all got on, proffering dollars or passes as we hurried for a seat. Again the man was ahead of me, so I kept seeing the clean hand running restlessly through the thick, graying hair. I hoped the man got home safely. Although no one showed any antipathy, I wondered how it would turn out if the stranger had asked someone for help.\\r\\nAgain, images came out of the air. Horns blared as a tangled mass of cars, bikes, and an isolated bullock cart moved off from a busy intersection. Under a huge poster advertising the latest romantic comedy, a youth had spread a cloth on the sidewalk, and joined by two companions, set up a brisk, trebly rhythm. They faltered for a moment, and the leader, hardly out of boyhood though he tried to be more, looked at his companions with a hint of irritation. The boy with wavy hair and taut grin started again on his little drum, and the third member of the company, a child playing a sort of one string harp, held his instrument aloft for a moment and shuffled around nervously. The leader struck a note on his lute, spun round on the toes of one foot, and howled out in anguish and a terrible solitude.\\r\\nPassersby gave some coins; some left food, and some smiled and watched the impassioned pleas to God and charity under the fierce Indian sun. A hundred yards away, another sad-eyed youngster gritted his teeth and longed for lessons to finish, so he could escape from the crowded streets to play cricket.\\r\\nHere on the bus there was much less to take someone’s thoughts from the grind of the mundane. Misanthropes informed anyone who was within earshot about the latest stand they were taking. Men who couldn’t fasten their trousers told everyone where they were going wrong. Others incessantly related minute details of their personal lives.\\r\\nWhere was the stranger now? Had he tried to withdraw to a far-off place, or was he just saying bad things about his workmates, the bus driver, and the library service? I saw his head move as he continued to talk, and the bus moved on. I got off before him, and I remembered him for a long time.\\r\\nThe other day I was going up an escalator, he was descending on the opposite side, and the moment I saw him I remembered the long wait for the bus the first time I had seen him. This time he was a little grayer, and wasn’t saying a word. The first time I saw him, I have strong suspicions, he was just having a bad day.\r\nfiction ', 'The Man With Gray Hair by Mark Stewart Cassidy', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-man-with-gray-hair-by-mark-stewart-cassidy', '', '', '2020-08-04 22:33:02', '2020-08-05 06:33:02', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=12', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The tar surface was hot and soft to the touch, and he liked the smell of it. There were no cars on the road. Only three people in the whole street owned a car, and they were away somewhere, probably at work, he supposed. He closed his eyes, and the world became orange. He thought of his dog, Bonzo, who was orange and white. The dog had a way of trotting at an angle, which the boy admired very much. Sometimes he tried to walk like that himself.\\r\\nThe boy opened his eyes just as a red and black butterfly flitted across the road. The boy, whose name was Sam, let his thoughts float after it. He thought about the Raymond gang, which had a membership of four; Raymond Chine, Stuart, Sam himself, and his brother Keith. The two boys were very comfortable with each other, although in fact they were not really brothers, or even related. They were, however, equally stubborn. When Gill bought them a cricket set, consisting of two bats, some stumps and a ball, the boys took it all down to Valentine''s Park and had a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours. When it was time to go home, they were both tired, and neither one wanted to carry the equipment back up the hill which lead to home. After some argument, Keith left it on a low coping wall for Sam to pick up. Sam left it there, expecting Keith to go back for it. When they got home, Gill sent them back for it, but by that time, of course, it had gone.\\r\\nSam was a sort of out-rider for the gang. When someone said, \"I dare you\", they all knew he was the one who would carry out the dare. The boys sensed a kind of wildness in Sam, which set him a little apart from them; \"I dare you to climb to the top of that tree\", \"I dare you to lift that lady''s skirt\", or put pennies on the railway line for the train to flatten out, or jump off the bus while it was moving. Once he even took a half crown from Auntie Eva''s purse. He took it to the local sweetshop but he had no idea what to buy with it. The shopkeeper took him back home. Auntie Eva gently explained to him that it was wrong to take money without asking. She didn''t seem angry, and she didn''t scold him. He felt so ashamed that he promised himself he would never do anything like that again.\\r\\nSam had been with the Draysons since he was three years old. Before that he had lived a very long way away, in Scotland, with his mother. He had no memories of that time, but Eva and Gill Drayson sometimes mentioned it. Auntie Eva told him that his mother had been on her own, and that times had been hard because of the war. She said that his mother had to go into the farmer''s fields at night sometimes, to steal turnips; otherwise they might both have starved. Sam didn''t really think about things like that, but he stored it away somewhere at the back of his mind, as something to mull over when he was older, and could perhaps understand it.\\r\\nRight now he had more interesting things to think about. Like Deirdre Ross, for instance. She always seemed to know more about the mysterious world of grown-ups than did the boys. She wasn''t part of the Raymond gang, but often hung around with the boys, who tolerated her because of the indefinable air she carried, of knowing more about the way the world worked than they did. Yesterday she had told the boys that she knew a secret. \"Keep it under your hat, boys, but I know where babies come from\", she confided in a stage whisper, and pointed vaguely towards her tummy. Sam thought of a baby in a hat. A top hat. It was all a bit confusing, and he added it to his list of things to mull over at a later stage.\\r\\nSam let the sun soak into him. Could life get any better? High up, a single-engine airplane droned slowly across the sky, the sound getting fainter as it moved away. He watched it until it disappeared. He remembered that he had asked Uncle Gill if there would ever be another war. Gill had been mending a shoe on an iron last. He looked at Sam. \"I hope not, boy,\" he said. The war had ended three years ago. On the rare occasions that he had been taken to visit his mother in London, Sam had seen the bombsights which still littered the streets, looking like missing teeth. There were more fields then streets where the Draysons lived, and there had been no bombing raids here in the war, but still, Sam thought, if there were another war, the Germans might concentrate on his area next time.\\r\\nHe thought about his house disappearing with a loud bang, and Bonzo running down the street with his funny sideways gait, and his tail between his legs. He tried to imagine the street without his house in it, and couldn''t. The house was all he knew; the kitchen where Auntie Eva placed him on the sideboard and scrubbed his face and knees with a flannel at teatime, the dining room with the big radio and the brown tiled fireplace, and the front room with the piano, which nobody ever went into. The main bedroom upstairs, which belonged to Eva and Gill, had a clock on the wall which was taller than Sam, and was operated by a system of weights and chains. Sam never really understood anything at all about that clock.\\r\\nThere were two other bedrooms; one for the girls, Tommy and Pam, and the box room at the end of the passage, which was shared by Keith and Sam. Next door lived Raymond Chine, the nominal leader of the Raymond gang, although Keith was the real leader. Raymond''s father was a bus conductor, but Gill Drayson was a bus driver, which was far superior. Once a woman had thrown herself in front of his bus. Gill stopped the bus inches from her head. When the company measured the skid, they decided to give him an award for quick thinking. The boys were very proud of that.\\r\\nSam heard a car turn into the road, and decided to sit up. The road shimmered in the heat of the afternoon. The car, a small black Austin, drove slowly down the road and disappeared around the corner, leaving a smell of exhaust fumes in the air. Sam considered his options. He could find the gang and see if they wanted to go over to the Crooked Billet farm, and throw stones at the windows of the abandoned farmhouse. Or he could see if he could catch a lizard in the field behind the street, although you really needed two for that - one to distract the lizard and one to creep up behind and catch it before it disappeared in the long grass. Or he could just lie down on the road again and look at the sun through his fingers. Yes, that would be the best plan. It must be teatime soon, and they would probably send Bonzo out to look for him. He thought about Bonzo''s funny walk, and smiled.\\r\\n<em>James Donaldson Collins started writing articles and essays about two years ago, as a relaxation from his work as a pet portrait artist, guitar teacher, dog walker and taxi driver.

I looked out over the city of Fairview. A city that wasn''t what people imagined it to be. No skyscrapers, no busied traffic, no flashy suits or crowded sidewalks. It was a small city that rested between the Rocky Mountains of Colorado.\\r\\nIt was early in the morning. Clouds gathered up behind the mountains at this time and then bled out extraordinary storms in the afternoon. The lightning was the worst, but that was just my opinion, I had a terrible fear of it.\\r\\nI turned each page of my tattered notebook like a delicate napkin, threatened that it would break apart and fly aloft into the steady wind, floating down onto streets and highways, anonymous to everyone that it used to be something of value to me.\\r\\n<em>I hate starting new paragraphs with \"I\", damn it, I did it again. I ripped out the paper in my notebook and started over. Don''t do it again. don''t be tempted to.</em>\\r\\nRain speckled the windshield like snowflakes in October. The clouds darkened off to the right and trailed off over the mountains. My parents didn''t want me getting my permit till I was 16 so they drove me all over the place. I could care less about driving. After all, the gas prices had gone to hell.\\r\\nThe traffic started to slow down and then came to a complete stop. I leaned up to look over the van in front of us. More cars, lots more, all lined up down the road in endless numbers.\\r\\n\"Fuck!\" My dad roared.\\r\\nRush hour. the worst part of the afternoon besides the lightning. Why can''t all the cars just float away?\\r\\nMy dad turned off the car and lay back in his seat with his eyes closed as I stared at the back bumper of the van in front of us. Off in the distance, cars began to float up into the sky, one after another, bending off over the mountains and fading off over the horizon in all directions until the highway lay completely bare.\\r\\nMy dad opened his eyes, stunned, as if he''d opened his refrigerator and found baby chickens climbing out of egg cartons, \"How long was I asleep?\" He asked, turning the car back on and slowly succeeding down the road.\\r\\n<em>This is going no where. I scratched out half of what I had written and started over.</em>\\r\\nThe bomb dropped like Hiroshima on the cars in front of us. The sky lit up brighter than the sun as tiny particles of what use to be cars blasted out past us like a deadly hurricane. I looked over at my dad, who hadn''t witnessed anything. He opened his eyes and looked out onto the gigantic crater that had formed off in the distance, \"What the hell?!\" he yelled.\\r\\n<em>What the hell is right.What the hell am I doing? I turned each page in frustration. Faster and faster I peeled through them until one of the pages tore off and twirled off down the hill in troubled elegance.\\r\\n\"Shit!\" I yelled, trying to snatch it before it broke away from my grasp. My frustration gathered and I opened to a new page in my notebook.</em>\\r\\nElliot Kole was always listening to the blues, the old stuff, before the covers and the cheap imitations, Clapton being an exception. He used to play along to it on his guitar for hours at a time until one of his strings snapped from playing too aggressively.\\r\\n<em>Wait. no. stop.I ripped the page out completely and started over.</em>\\r\\nWe arrived at the hardware store with no traffic on the way, no bombs, or sudden changes in gravity. My dad and I walked through each hallway looking for tools for his shop. He was planning on building the Ark when the great storm hit. It would come in a couple days over the Rocky Mountains and wash away the entire human race, all because of global warming. Wow, how great is that?\\r\\n\"Can I help you?\" One of the store employees asked.\\r\\nMy dad looked over at the man like he was looking at a ghost. He shook his head and walked on down the hall silently.\\r\\n\"We''re fine,\" I replied. The man shrugged and walked away. My father was a bit depressed about the future, so he spoke little. He was focused only on getting the right tools, the tools to build the Ark to save our family and maybe thousands of other people from a perilous death. Suddenly, there was a huge explosion that crashed out from above us.\\r\\nWait. what was that? My eyes opened up to darkness, pure darkness. I squinted as rain drops dripped down across my eyelashes and through my clothing. The notebooks in my left hand were somewhat scattered out near the tips of my fingers as if I had suddenly fallen asleep and pushed them aside.\\r\\nThen there was a terrifying flash of lightning that lit up the sky for a brief second. Thunder followed it almost immediately, crackling and echoing out into the expanse like the snapping of burning wood over a large fire. I froze completely, paralyzed in the soaking wet grass that attempted to drown me as it became wetter and wetter. I leaned forward with my notebooks in my hand and looked out onto the other hills in shock. Each hill had become its own island, mine being the largest. I tried to find the remains of Fairview below the depths of the Western sea and saw nothing more than the reflection of black ink sky.\\r\\nOff in the distance I saw an enormous, wooden ship. I stood up and started waving furiously to catch its attention over the thickening fog. It didn''t take long for it to reach me and when it did, I was amazed to find that it was my father leading it.\\r\\n\"Take that ladder!\" He yelled.\\r\\nI grabbed the rope ladder hanging off the side of the boat and slowly climbed onboard. I kept my head leveled to the ground as waterfalls of water lashed out past my face.\\r\\n\"A-are we going to die?!\" I shouted over the storm.\\r\\n\"I don''t know!\" Was his reply, which was barely audible as the lions roared out through the heavens.\\r\\nI shuddered as more lightning scattered through the air. I worried about it striking the boat. I worried about it taking my life. Frying every organ in my body and blowing pieces of my brains all over the place. I''d lay down, lifeless, with smoke dissolving off of my charred body.\\r\\nI looked over at my father with his buckets, scooping out water that flooded the boat constantly. I felt like helping him but I didn''t know what to do. I didn''t know anything at the moment, I was terrified and confused. I looked around the boat at groups of other people, huddled up against the walls of the boat, petrified.\\r\\nAnd unexpectedly, everything began to smear. I watched in terror as huge tsunamis cornered us at every direction. I watched as the boat literally melted onto the sea and evaporated into the air. The fingers on my hands began to disintigrate in every way without discharging any pain. I tried to scream but my face curled into a misshapen ball. I could hear everyone around me screaming as their bodies fused together. I could''ve sworn that I had just died at that moment as an awkward silence sounded out around me, followed by the soft sound of spring wind. I could see only white, I could feel nothing, and do absolutely nothing. I could only listen to the strange sounds that seemed to secrete around me.\\r\\n<em>Ah! I''m doing it again! No more \"I\"''s! No more \"I\"''s I erased everything I had written and heaved a huge sigh of irritation. And I''m still doing it! There''s no stopping it! I stood up with the notebooks in my hands and stepped down the hill furiously. I decided to stop there and go home. Home was about four miles from here. It would probably take thirty minutes to walk there.\\r\\nOnce I had cleared the hills I peered down across the highway which sat peacefully as cars drove across it this way and that. The lane coming towards me was crowded with traffic that had come to a complete stop. People honked and tried to drive down the side of the road but ended up getting caught by the cops halfway across.\\r\\nI looked up into the sky at a large ball of light surging towards them at great speeds while cars began to lift off from the ground and float off through the sky, vanishing over mountains and crashing into small towns. The Rocky Mountains erupted with lava that flooded the cities around them. The skies slowly grew darker and darker till everything became pitch black and I could see nothing, feel nothing, and do absolutely nothing. The creases and folds would come next, and I would be ready, as long as it wasn''t lightning, I would be ready. </em>', 'Creases and Folds by Scott Jensen', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'creases-and-folds-by-scott-jensen', '', '', '2020-08-08 23:38:15', '2020-08-09 07:38:15', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=16', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(17, 1, '2020-08-10 00:11:28', '2020-08-10 08:11:28', 'Often, usually around the holidays, my large, extended family causes me to go to my “Happy Place” (usually, The Bahamas). I can go there any time I want... without moving a muscle. All I do is look to the sky and make myself believe that it is the sky above a beach in the Bahamas. I’m there that quickly.\\r\\n“It would be a gray world without the family,” says my wife, Linda.\\r\\nIt’s always the same: My niece, Beth, calls a month before Thanksgiving to invite me, Linda, and our daughter, Shelley, to the Annual Thanksgiving Family Feast.\\r\\n“And, this year, Jimmy is doing the Small Turkey in my back yard. He bought a deep fryer at Big K” Beth shouts into the speaker-phone.\\r\\n“Isn’t that dangerous, Beth?” asks Linda. “All the kids around?”\\r\\n“Jimmy’s a cop, Linda.” (condescending tone) “He understands safety.”\\r\\nLinda knows my brother, Jimmy, is a cop. She also knows Jimmy enjoys his beer... by the keg.\\r\\n“I’m asking everyone to bring a little something,” Beth tells Linda. “I have you down for the Big Turkey and one pie – pecan, if you can manage. Will that work for you?”\\r\\n“What else can we bring?” asks Linda. “Shelley makes a mean three-bean salad.”\\r\\nLinda always supplies the Big Turkey, and someone brings the Small Turkey so that none of us family members, assorted friends and lovers will go without. (This year, Joyce, one of my single nieces, brought a guy she met the night before in a singles bar.)\\r\\nThe reason Linda is anxious to do the bird is because the one time Beth did the Big Turkey, she neglected to thaw it, and, to be kind, as I pushed it around my plate and said “yum”, I was put in mind of a cave man’s menu before he discovered fire.\\r\\nAfter the call, I get the vision: Linda up at 4:30, chucking the mostly thawed, twenty-five pound turkey into the sink, and then asking me to pull the legs apart. I have to use tools to get the wire thing off that holds the legs together.\\r\\nI think about acquiring three of those wire things that hold legs together and giving them to my three married nieces who are in a competition to see how many children they can produce before they are thirty-five. Currently, the score is Beth – five, Helen – four, and Monica – two (with one in the oven). Total of eleven, all of whom should be kept in cages. Their primary entertainment at these gatherings is screaming, wailing, fighting, bleeding, going to the emergency room, and head butting my pregnant nieces in the stomach.\\r\\n“That’s what kids do, Jack,” Linda explains to me.\\r\\nAll the buzz in the family prior to this year’s Feast is about Jimmy. Such excitement. “Jimmy’s going to DEEP FRY the Small Turkey!”\\r\\nLinda’s modest contribution - three-fourths of the feast - is no longer a motivation for family praise. “Jimmy’s going to DEEP FRY! And Helen is doing her Carrot Soup! (It’s yellow, and tastes yellow.) And Kathleen’s going to make her Irish Soda Bread!” (If you are ever offered Irish Soda Bread or Carrot Soup, just say No.)\\r\\nKathleen is my older sister, the grandmother of the evil eleven. She, along with her Jewish/Dentist husband, hosts the annual Christmas Feast which is a Xeroxed copy of the Thanksgiving Feast, but at the Christmas Family Feast we have the added bonus of a two-hour present-opening ceremony conducted by a Jewish/dentist/ Santa Clause.\\r\\nMy little family, hauling the carved turkey and three pecan pies, arrived at Beth’s house just before the fire truck arrived.\\r\\nAs Beth chews on a cracker and stares at her back fence, which now is a ground level row of black ash being watered down by a fireman with a high powered hose, Jimmy is explaining to her that the fire wasn’t his fault.\\r\\nI’m taking my deep fryer back to Big K, Beth,” Jimmy slurred, squinting his glassy eyes. “Defective deep-fryer! I’m going to get those Big K sumbitches. They’re going to pay, Beth,” continued Jimmy, poking his finger into Beth’s chest as if she were one of the Big K sumbitches, “And if they give me even one little bit of shit about rebuilding the fence, there’s going to be some MAJOR ass-whippin’ goin’ on.” (Is there minor ass-whippin’?)\\r\\nJimmy’s turkey is presented to the table for carving. It looks to me like a ten pound charcoal briquette.\\r\\n“Dark on the outside, juicy on the inside,” says the dentist, smiling - calculating, no doubt, the dental bills he would be sending out to family members.\\r\\nThen, Monica, my niece with only two kids, flops her bare breast right out on the table across from me as I am chewing my first bite of Jimmy’s turkey, which I had been chewing for ten minutes.\\r\\n“Could you put that thing away until I’m finished, here, Monica...Sweetheart?\\r\\nI don’t think she heard me. As she draws her latest product to her breast for suckling, she looks up at me and smiles. I think she copied this knowing and serene expression from one of those pictures of the Virgin Mary you see in church.\\r\\n“Isn’t nature beautiful, Uncle Jack?”\\r\\n“Beautiful,” I say.\\r\\nBesides being a “stay-at-home mom” and “home-schooler,” she serves meals to the homeless on Tuesdays. Monica is a Doctor of Psychology, which reminds me of a quote somewhere that says people become psychologists to find out why they, themselves, are such deranged, freaking nut-balls.\\r\\nAs tradition dictated, before dessert everyone is required to tell what they are most thankful for. It is always the same. Everyone is thankful for their husbands or wives or girlfriends, and the ones with children or grandchildren are most thankful for them. Yada, yada, yada, I think.\\r\\nWhen it is my turn, I want to break the mold.\\r\\n“I am most thankful for my daughter and for Linda.” That’s the way everyone else began. “I will never forget the day Linda and I met forty five years ago. Linda’s scented panties floating down from her third-floor dorm window and landing smack on top of my head. Yes, I sure got lucky with Linda....and that was just last night!”\\r\\nTons of laughter. (Kathleen spewed coffee through her nose.) Tons of scowls, too.\\r\\n“And I love all of you. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”\\r\\nWhere did those words come from? They couldn’t have come from my mouth. Not from my brain. Do I have a soul?\\r\\nWhen Beth set out the dessert, Linda’s three pecan pies were gone before Shelley or I had a chance to snag a piece. I ended up with a Mexican cookie. (“Monica’s Mexican Cookies!”)\\r\\n“Floss, anyone?” asked the dentist, after the clan had devoured most of the dessert.\\r\\nEveryone needed floss. The Doctor handed out foot-long strings, and everyone flossed. The guy my niece had picked up in the bar wanted seconds. He asked for seconds of floss!\\r\\nThat’s the last thing I remember – everyone standing around the dessert table... flossing.\\r\\nI looked out to the sky and went to the Bahamas.', 'Family Thanksgiving by Michael J.

It rolled to a stop just before going into the pond that bordered the left side of the fairway. \"Nothing wrong with that,\" I said.\\r\\nLarry teed up next. \"I''m going to focus on my golf today.

I think I know it''s a secret, Larry.\"\\r\\n\"In fifth grade the kids used to call me ''Larry the fairy.'' I didn''t know what a fairy was back then.\"\\r\\nWhen we were younger men, Larry was my college roommate for three years. We even went to high school together, but we didn''t spend any time together back then. I was a jock, and he was the smartest guy at Saint Joe''s High School for Boys. Our social circles excluded one another. Even at Saint Ambrose College for Men in Northern California, Larry excluded me. He taped a strip of masking tape down the middle of our room and ordered me to stay on my side. He was very neat and studious, and I was a sloppy pig, a student of marginal ability and motivation. I should have gone to Viet Nam, but I didn''t.\\r\\nLater in our lives we experienced success, each in our own way. He became a successful and profitable sports psychologists, teaching at San Diego State and writing books - The Psychology of Tennis, The Psychology of Skiing, The Psychology of Golf - Same book over and over again, but they sold like crazy. I taught high school English and coached football. We are still both married to our first wives, but Larry has a complication. Thirty years ago his wife got knocked up by one of his graduate school classmates, and twenty-eight years ago, Larry knocked up his married graduate assistant, a girl who put herself through college dancing at a topless bar. The resulting daughter is now a college graduate, courtesy of Larry, and a college P.E teacher and soccer coach. The \"other women\" also profited from Larry''s generosity. After she divorced her husband six years ago, she now lives in an up-scale, three bedroom condo, courtesy of Larry.\\r\\n\"But, you ought to be getting pussy, Larry,\" I said, \"from someone.\"\\r\\nOn the first green Tom rolled in an eighteen foot put for a bogie.\\r\\n\"Way to go, partner,\" said EdBob, giving Tom a high five. \"Can''t win ''em all if you don''t win the first one.\"\\r\\n\"That''s a good thought, EdBob,\" I said, \"but Tom''s not your partner. \"We''re playing Left and Right like Larry said. Tom is my partner.\"\\r\\n\"I thought we were playing Partners,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"What''s wrong with Wolf,\" said EdBob.\\r\\nHOLE # 2, PAR 3, 139 YARDS, HANDICAP #17, NOTE: SAND LEFT AND RIGHT. ..\\r\\n\"If I ever walk like those guys, I give you permission to shoot me,\" said Tom, as we all waited on the tee for the foursome in front of us to clear the green. \"They shouldn''t let those old fuckers out here on Saturday mornings.\"\\r\\n\"We''re all going to be old fuckers some day,\" I said.\\r\\n\"Someday?\" questioned EdBob. \"You and Larry are already there.\" He laughed again at his own joke.\\r\\n\"At least you two don''t walk like old fuckers,\" said Tom, nodding toward the second green where the old guys were finishing up their putting.\\r\\n\"We''re all afraid of getting old, Tom,\" said Larry. \"No one wants to walk like an old guy. That''s why Jack walks so fast all the time.\"\\r\\n\"They''re walking off,\" I said. \"If you guys would shut up for a minute, I''d like to tee off.\" I hit a seven iron just through the left sand trap onto the back fringe. \"Easy up and down,\" I said. \"What do you mean, ''That''s why Jack walks so fast''?\"\\r\\n\"You want to look young, Jack,\" said Larry, as he teed up his ball.\\r\\n\"Could maybe we stop all the psychological bullshit?\" said EdBob. \"Could maybe we just play a little golf?\"\\r\\nLarry''s shot was down the middle, but ten yards short of the green.\\r\\nBack in the cart I asked Larry again, \"What do you mean about the way I walk?\"\\r\\n\"The older you get the faster you walk,\" he answered. \"What are you running away from?\"\\r\\nFact is I''ve walked fast since I was in high school. There, I did everything I could to avoid going to classes. My best scam was to get elected or appointed to some nothing Student Body position - Assistant to the Athletic Director, Sophomore Class Vice President - and then always carry a clip board and WALK FAST. When a priest would inquire as to why I wasn''t in class, I would quicken my pace, wave my clip board at him, and say, \"Student Body business, Father.\" Worked every single time, and the fast walk habit stuck with me.\\r\\n\"So, Larry, I really want to know, why do you have two women and no pussy?\"\\r\\n\"You know all about that. You know everything,\" he answered.\\r\\n\"You ever take your wife anywhere? You never say anything about that?\"\\r\\n\"Not for the past thirty years. That''s why I can still be a Catholic. I''m faithful to only one woman.\" Silence for too long. \"Okay,\" he continued. \"I know...my life is pretty fucked up.\"\\r\\nOn the green EdBob putted a twelve foot putt that went fifteen feet past the hole.\\r\\nYou''re stabbing at the ball, EdBob,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"Don''t coach, Tom,\" said EdBob. \"If I wanted lessons, I''d go to the pro shop.\"\\r\\n\"Just trying to help,\" said Tom. \"I think they got two inches tall.\"\\r\\n\"What?\" asked Larry.\\r\\n\"Her nipples,\" answered Tom. \"Isn''t that what we were talking about?\"\\r\\nHole #3, Par 4, HANDICAP #15, NOTE: DOGLEG RIGHT/WATER LEFT. .\\r\\n\"So, you going to tell me who it was last night, Tom?\" asked Larry , still sitting in his cart writing down scores from the second hole.\\r\\n\"Mary Stoop,\" answered Tom, as he used the ball washer.\\r\\n\"Blonde? About forty something?\"\\r\\n\"Yea,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"God,\" shouted Larry, suddenly abandoning his scorekeeping duties. \"She was a patient of mine. When I cleaned her teeth, she always wore a slinky blouse and no bra. She was married back then.\"\\r\\n\"Yeah, she talked about you. Said you always tried to look down her blouse. She''s still married,\" said Tom. \"She doesn''t own one. A bra, I mean. She says her breasts have to breathe.\"\\r\\n\"Republican, right wing bitch,\" I said, nodding toward the house next to the third tee box, and thinking of Toni, the woman who lived inside.\\r\\n\"Why don''t you let it go, Jack,\" said EdBob. \"Every time you get here, your game goes to hell for two or three holes.\"\\r\\nTwo or three months earlier I had gotten into a screaming match in the 19th Hole Lounge with Toni. I knew she had voted for Bush, and I made the mistake of asking her what she thought about Bush''s war we were losing.\\r\\n\"We need to stay the course,\" she said.\\r\\n\"Why?\" I asked her. \"And what course?\"\\r\\n\"It''s better to fight them over there than over here,\" she said between sips of iced tea. She was so right-wing, she didn''t even drink regular booze.\\r\\n\"Toni,\" I said, \"I''m trying to be calm, here. One easy question - Why did we invade Iraq?\"\\r\\n\"Helloooo,\" she said. \"Did you forget about Nine-Eleven? Did you forget they were building a newclear bomb to drop on us? Did you forget they were getting ready to send model airplanes to spray us with poison? Did you forget their, so called, god, Buddha, tells them to kill us all? Did you forget they were training Muslim terrorists?\"\\r\\n\"Helloooo,\" I answered. \"Iraq had nothing to do with Nine-Eleven. There were no weapons. Iraqis don''t believe in Buddha. Saddam was killing all the Muslim terrorists. There were no model airplanes. Everyone who can read knows this now, Toni. No wonder Bush won the election. Idiots like you, who don''t know their ass from a manhole cover, voted for him. There must be a lot of you retarded bitches out there.\"\\r\\nHer husband, a retired San Diego policeman, then beat the shit out of me, and Lisa, the bartender, banned me from the bar for a month\r\n.\\r\\n\"Let it go,\" EdBob said again. \"You''re going to screw up your round.\" But, it was too late. I hit my tee shot out of bounds to the right, into a guy''s back yard.\\r\\n\"Lot of anger in that swing,\" said Tom. \"When you cleaned her teeth, did you see her nipples, Larry? Why didn''t you drug her up? You could have looked all you wanted?\"\\r\\n\"You''re one, sick fucker,\" said EdBob, after hitting his first good tee shot down the left side of the fairway.\\r\\n\"At least I''m not sleeping in my garage,\" countered Tom. Moments later, after hitting his first bad drive of the day - high and short - Tom said, \"Sorry I said that, Partner. That was chickenshit.\r\n\"\\r\\n\"You''re right, Tom,\" said EdBob. \"That was chickenshit. I may have to tell Jack to kick your fat ass.\"\\r\\nI didn''t laugh, but the three others almost fell down laughing. I knew they were remembering the ass whipping I took in the bar.\\r\\n\"That''s not funny,\" I said, touching the small bump that remained under my left eye.\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said Tom, gasping for breath, tears streaming down his cheeks. \"We weren''t laughing at..\"\\r\\nHe couldn''t finish. He was laughing too hard.\\r\\nAt the green, EdBob''s ball was in the fringe, and he chipped it in for a par. \"I did that for you, Partner,\" he said, pointing at me.\\r\\n\"Jack''s not your partner, EdBob,\" said Larry. \"We''re playing Left/Right. Remember?\"\\r\\n\"I thought it was Partners,\" said Tom\\r\\nHole #4, PAR 5, 486 YARDS, #7 HANDICAP, NOTE: NOTE: TREES AND HOUSES ON RIGHT/ UP HILL LAST 50 YARDS.\\r\\n\"So, everyone is clear on the game we''re playing?\" said Larry, as he looked down the fourth fairway.\\r\\n\"All clear,\" said Tom. \"So, why don''t you divorce the bitch, EdBob?\"\\r\\n\"You don''t call a guy''s wife a bitch,\" I said, checking my scorecard. I was three over par after three holes. I was hoping for better after all the secret practicing I did during the week.\\r\\n\"He calls her bitch all the time,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"That doesn''t mean you can,\" I said. \"It''s like calling a black guy a nigger. If a black guy does it, it''s okay, but not you.\"\\r\\n\"I agree with EdBob,\" said Tom. \"We need to stop all the philosophy bullshit. I was just wondering why EdBob won''t get a divorce. You don''t have to analyze everything all the time, Jack.\"\\r\\nLarry said, \"What did you get on the last hole, EdBob.\"\\r\\n\"Par,\" said EdBob.\\r\\n\"Really?\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"You questioning my integrity?\" asked EdBob. \"You think I''m cheating at golf?\"\\r\\nThe code of golfers, even weekend hackers like us: You can cheat on your taxes, you can cheat on your wife, but, you never, never, never cheat at golf. All the guys with whom I played followed the code, no matter how they cheated off the golf course. Maybe if we never left the course, we''d all be eligible for heaven.\\r\\n\"Sorrreeeee,\" said Tom. \"I was just asking.\"\\r\\n\"Well, don''t ask,\" muttered EdBob.\\r\\nEdBob didn''t speak to anyone until we reached the fourth green. Then his words were mechanical: \"You want the flag out? Is my mark okay?\"\\r\\nA month or so earlier, Tom and EdBob almost got into an actual fistfight on the ninth tee. Tom''s false teeth stopped the fight before it began. He said he had to take them out before he could whip EdBob''s ass.\\r\\n\"If you have to take out your teeth before fighting, Tom,\" I said, \"maybe it''s a sign.\"\\r\\n\"If you''re saying I''m too old, I''m not. I still get a lot of pussy, man. And, I can whip EdBob''s ass on my worst day. I was in the Golden Gloves.\"\\r\\nLooking at Tom''s plumb, squatty body, Larry and I were struck with the contrast between our vision and his words, and could not contain our laughter. It was contagious, and the bomb was diffused. Even Tom laughed, just not as much as we did.\\r\\nI putted in from four feet for a bogie (another bogie). \"What''s the game score?\" I asked Larry.\\r\\n\"I think we''re all square. No blood.\"\\r\\n\"Bullshit,\" said Tom. \"EdBob parred the last hole. Didn''t that put us ahead?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Larry. \"Jack and I had strokes.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, that''s right,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"Are you questioning my integrity?\" asked Larry, mocking EdBob, making an effort at humor. No one laughed.\\r\\nHole #5, 404 YARDS, PAR 4, #1 HANDICAP. NOTE: NEED A LONG DRIVE.\\r\\nI told myself to swing easy - hit hard, but it didn''t work. At the top of my takeaway, I had the thought that that I could get my first 250 yard drive if I gave it just a little extra. I topped the ball. It dribbled forward just past the women''s tee.\\r\\n\"At least you don''t have to take your dick out,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"Real Man Rules,\" stated that if you did not drive your ball past the women''s tee, you had to hang your wanger out for the rest of the round to show that you were not a woman.\\r\\nI was angry. At myself. \"At least if I hung it, it would be visible,\" I said to Tom.\\r\\n\"You want to play ''Whip It Out'' right now?\" asked Tom.\\r\\n\"Whip It Out\" was an old grammar school game in which seventh grade boys compared their manhood with their peers.\\r\\n\"Jesus, Tom,\" said Larry. \"Grow up, man.\"\\r\\n\"First you tell me I''m old, then you tell me to grow up. What the fuck.\"\\r\\n\"I didn''t say you were too old, Tom,\" said Larry.\"\\r\\n\"Jack did. He said I had a little dick.\"\\r\\n\"Could we maybe get some golf in between all this bullshit?\" asked EdBob, just before he made his second good drive in a row.\\r\\nBack in the cart, Larry asked me why no one ever laughed at anything he said. I got the idea it bothered him.\\r\\n\"I don''t know,\" I said. \"I still want to know why you take care of two women and get no pussy.\"\\r\\n\"Jack, we''re almost sixty-five. Guy''s sixty-five don''t have sex. And, Rachel''s almost as old as I am. Remember when we were young guys? We thought old people screwing was really sick.\\r\\n\"That''s because we were young and dumb.\"\\r\\n\"I still think like that. How come EdBob got so quiet?\"\\r\\n\"You don''t have to tell old women what to do. They have all that experience. They know everything.\" I said. \"EdBob''s afraid of being alone, like all the rest of us.\"\\r\\nI''ve known EdBob for almost twenty years. His history with women has been rocky. wife, Carol, a counselor at the high school where EdBob teaches. I liked Carol, kind of. I wouldn''t have chosen her as a wife, but I thought she was okay for EdBob. She left EdBob because of EdBob. EdBob drinks. Carol told my wife that EdBob wasn''t a husband at all during their last few years of marriage. He drank and went out to his workshop where he made fishing lures.\\r\\nThe woman he is now married to (her name is Cindy) is a complete nut ball. Everything I know is second hand. She''s got one of those disorders that make her go crazy when she has even a drop of alcohol. She''s done violent things to EdBob. He has bite marks all over him. She beat on his golf cart with a seven iron. She smashed his car windshield with a hammer. I''ve seen all the damage, but I get only EdBob''s side of the story. Maybe Cindy has a story too, but I''ll never know.\\r\\nHole #6, 329 YARDS, PAR 4, HANDICAP #9. NOTE: BLIND TEE SHOT UP HILL. OUR OF BOUNDS AND SAND TRAP RIGHT, FOREST OF OAKS ON LEFT. I HATE THIS HOLE.\\r\\n\"I hate this hole,\" said EdBob, as he stopped his cart next to the tee.\\r\\n\"You''ve got to love it, EdBob,\" I said. \"As long as you have to play it, you might as well love it.\"\\r\\n\"Shut up, Jack,\" said Tom. \"I''ll bet you''ve never had bad sex.\"\\r\\n\"The worst sex I''ve ever had was sensational,\" I answered.\\r\\n\"I''m hitting,\" said Larry, teeing up his ball. \"It''s pretty hard for me to concentrate with all this bullshit going on all the time.\"\\r\\n\"It''s only golf, Larry,\" I said.\\r\\n\"Golf is the most fun thing in my life,\" said Larry.\\r\\n\"You like golf better than pussy?\" asked EdBob.\\r\\n\"Shut up, EdBob,\" said Larry, before hitting his shot into the oaks on the left.\\r\\n\"At least you''re not out of bounds,\" I said.\\r\\n\"Shut up, Jack,\" said Larry.\\r\\nI hit a good one, right down the middle to the top of the hill. \"Perfect,\" I said.\\r\\n\"You think every shot you hit is perfect,\" said Tom.\\r\\nSometimes I make myself sick. Tom was right. I tend to look for the silver lining. Find it even when it is not there. Maybe I''ve always been that way, or maybe I learned that as a high school football coach for forty years. During the bad years, when my teams were losing more than winning, I had to keep the kids hopeful. I had to come up with new goals and forget the old ones. I had to say things to them like, \"We''re going to play this last game for pride,\" and \"The next game is the only one that counts.\" Okay, it was kind of bullshit, but why make things worse than they have to be?\\r\\nTom had a bad sixth hole. He hit his tee shot out of bounds and then hit his second tee shot out of bounds. Then he said, \"Fuck it. I don''t give a shit,\" before stomping back to EdBob''s cart, sitting down in the passenger seat, folding his arms across his chest, and pouting. \"I''m out of the hole,\" he muttered.\\r\\n\"Jesus, Tom. It''s only golf, man,\" I said\\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said EdBob.\\r\\nTom said, \"Why do you let her treat you that way?\"\\r\\n\"He likes being treated that way,\" I said. \"Leave him alone.\"\\r\\n\"Why do you think you always have all the answers, Jack?\" said Tom, still pouting in the cart.\\r\\n\"Okay, I''ll shut up,\" I said, vowing to say nothing else for the rest of the round.\\r\\nLarry, driving me up the hill to where my ball lay, said, \"Hope I can find my ball. I wonder why Tom is so pissed.\"\\r\\n\"You''ll find it,\" I said, hoping I would not have to help him look. I hated looking for missing balls unless they were mine. I am selfish that way. \"Tom''s pissed because he''s Tom. After his next good shot, he''ll be fine. He doesn''t get all the women he says he gets.\"\\r\\n\"How do you know?\"\\r\\n\"If he did, he wouldn''t talk about it all the time.\"\\r\\nEven though Tom was out of the hole, it took a long time for us to complete number six. We looked for Larry''s ball for more than five minutes, which is the limit according to golf rules, but no one called a penalty. When we finally found it, Larry had no shot, but he tried anyhow and ended up with a triple bogie.\\r\\n\"All that practice,\" said Larry, scowling and writing down his score.\\r\\nHole #7, Par 4, 372 yards, #11 handicap. Notes: flat, not much trouble right or left. Almost boring.\\r\\nTom teed off on number seven even before we were off the number six green. \"We need to pick up the pace,\" he called, after hitting a good shot. He was looking at the foursome behind us who were standing on the top of the hill, looking down at the green. They all had their hands on their hips - the universal golf sign for \"Get a move on.\"\\r\\n\"Excuse me,\" said Larry. \"I lost a ball. Am I the only golfer to ever have to look for a ball?\"\\r\\n\"It''s time to change partners,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"We''re not playing partners,\" I said. \"We''re playing Left and Right.\"\\r\\n\"I thought we were playing Wolf,\" said EdBob.\\r\\n\"I''m keeping score for Left and Right,\" said Larry, \"but anything is okay with me.\" He drove his ball down the right side into the rough.\\r\\n\"You and Jack were partners for the first six holes,\" said Tom. \"Now I''ll toss a tee to see who my partner is now.\" Tom tossed the tee. It pointed at Larry.\\r\\nI took my bag off of Larry''s cart and strapped it onto EdBob''s. EdBob drove his ball left into the fairway bunker.\\r\\n\"Who won the first six holes?\" I asked.\\r\\n\"I don''t know,\" said Larry. \"I''ll have to figure that out. I was keeping score for Left and Right.\"\\r\\nI popped my ball up. Very short, but down the middle.\\r\\nTom loaded his bag onto Larry''s cart and hopped in the passenger seat. \"How can anyone play with EdBob?\" he asked Larry, loud enough for EdBob to hear. \"I feel an ass kickin'' coming on now that I have a real partner.\"\\r\\n\"We''ll see about that,\" I said. \"EdBob and I are the A Team.\"\\r\\n\"A for assholes,\" said Tom, laughing, as Larry sped away.\\r\\n\"Don''t let Tom get back into my cart,\" said EdBob, as he drove me to my ball.\\r\\n\"How come?\" I asked.\\r\\n\"He gives advice. He tells me to divorce Cindy, just because she beats up my cart and my car and bites me all over. She''s getting better, Jack. Swear to God.\"\\r\\n\"I don''t give advice, EdBob.\"\\r\\n\"I know. That''s why I like you riding in my cart. Jack, if you wanted to give me advice, what would you tell me about Cindy?\"\\r\\n\"I don''t even know Cindy. I don''t know your wife, EdBob.\"\\r\\n\"She''s a real bitch, Jack.\"\\r\\n\"Well, I''ve heard she''s done some evil things to you.\"\\r\\n\"She told me she was going to come on the golf course and fuck up our round today.\"\\r\\n\"No way.\"\\r\\n\"Way,\" said EdBob.\\r\\n\"Well, let''s not worry about it right now. Let''s just focus on golf.\"\\r\\n\"That''s what we''re here for, right?\"\\r\\nEdBob''s second shot went way off line to the right, into the street where it struck a passing UPS truck, rocketed back toward the green, and stopped in the short fringe just ten feet from the flag stick.\\r\\n\"I call major bullshit on that,\" said Tom. \"There''s got to be a rule about that. Your ball was out of bounds, EdBob.\"\\r\\n\"Was, is the key word, Tom,\" I said, defending my partner.\\r\\n\"It hit a moving vehicle. I''m checking this out when we make the turn.\"\\r\\n\"I know it''s okay, Tom,\" said Larry. \"It''s the same as if it hit a house out of bounds.\"\\r\\n\"Houses don''t speed down the fucking road at sixty miles an hour, for christsakes,\" said Tom. \"This is major bullshit.\"\\r\\n\"I think it''s bullshit too,\" said Larry, \"but I think it''s minor. Let''s just keep playing, Tom.\"\\r\\nAt the green EdBob putted his ball to within six inches, turned to Tom and said, \"That good?\"\\r\\nTom would normally \"give\" a putt that short, but now he said, \"Mark it or putt it.\"\\r\\n\"Fuck you, Tom,\" said EdBob, before tapping in his putt. He then turned to me and said \"We''ve been partners for one hole, and we''re already ahead by one.\" He then laughed. Tom''s putt ended about two feet from the hole. \"Mark it or putt it,\" said EdBob.\\r\\n\"It''s for a five,\" said Tom. \"It doesn''t matter.\"\\r\\n\"Mark it or putt it,\" EdBob repeated.\\r\\n\"Can''t we all just get along,\" said Larry.\\r\\nAfter missing his short putt, Tom said, \"I''ll never be able to get along with that penis head.\"\\r\\nHole #8, PAR 3, 178 YARDS, #13 HANDICAP. NOTE: SANDTRAPS LEFT AND RIGHT AND BACK.\\r\\nNo one hit the eighth green, the way the good golfers do. I was in the sand trap on the right. EdBob was down the middle but fifty yards short.\\r\\n\"One up, one in, and you''ve got your par, EdBob,\" I said to my partner.\\r\\n\"With my luck, I''ll probably hit in the sand trap,\" said EdBob. EdBob''s next shot went into the sand trap on the left. \"See what I mean?\"\\r\\n\"Well, if you have those negative thoughts, it screws up your swing.\"\\r\\n\"Wouldn''t you have negative thoughts if you had Cindy for a wife? What if you had to sleep in the garage? Wouldn''t you be a little negative?\"\\r\\nEdBob drove me to the green. \"I should probably divorce her,\" he said to me. \"What do you think?\"\\r\\n\"I don''t know,\" I said, looking at my ball in the sand trap and thinking about my shot. \"I don''t even know her, EdBob.\"\\r\\n\"You know she''s a bitch. I told you what a bitch she is.\"\\r\\nWhen I was over my ball, EdBob shut up. I hit the shot to thin. It skidded across the green and into the sand trap on the opposite side.\\r\\n\"At least you don''t have to change clubs,\" said Tom. He turned to Larry, hoping Larry was laughing. He wasn''t.\\r\\nLarry said, \"He probably feels bad enough.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, Jesus,\" said Tom. \"What are we doing here, playing the U.S. fucking Open? It''s only golf, for christsakes.\"\\r\\nTom chipped his ball to within six inches. I said, \"That''s good, Tom.\" Tom picked up the ball.\\r\\n\"I didn''t give you that putt,\" said EdBob.\\r\\n\"Your partner gave it to me,\" said Tom.\\r\\nLarry putted from off the green and went way past the hole.\\r\\n\"But I didn''t give it to you. Both guys on the opponent''s team have to give it to you.\"\\r\\n\"I gave him the putt, EdBob,\" I said. \"Shut up and let me hit my ball.\" I made a better sand shot this time but still had to putt twice and took a double bogie.\\r\\nEdBob also ended with a double bogie.\\r\\n\"Good ass whipping,\" Tom said to Larry, as the two walked off the green. \"We''re tied. I knew I''d start playing better when I got a partner who wasn''t a fuck face.\"\\r\\nWhen we got back to EdBob''s cart, all four tires were flat\r\n.\\r\\n\"All your tires are flat, EdBob,\" said Larry.\\r\\n\"The bitch,\" shouted EdBob. \"She told me she was going to foul up our round.\"\\r\\n\"What are you going to do about it, EdBob?\" asked Tom.\\r\\n\"Maybe it wasn''t her,\" said EdBob.\\r\\n\"It was her, EdBob,\" said Larry, pulling an ice pick from the back tire. \"She left the ice pick in the back tire. Who else?\"\\r\\n\"That does it for me. I''m going to have to confront her on this one.\"\\r\\nLarry called the pro shop on his cell phone. Jason, one of the assistant pros, came out with a cart for EdBob and me, and the marshal, Dave, said he could fix the ice pick damage. He towed EdBob''s cart and Jason back to the cart barn.\\r\\nHole #9, PAR 4, 375 YARDS, #5 HANDICAP. NOTE: SECOND SHOT OVER A STREAM, SAND TRAPS ALL AROUND THE GREEN. .\\r\\nTom and I hit our tee shots close to one another. EdBob dropped me off at my ball and took off in search of his, which he had pulled to the left. So, Tom and I were standing by our respective balls waiting for the old gentlemen to clear the green.\\r\\n\"Marilyn Stoop knows you, Jack,\" said Tom. \"She told me last night.\"\\r\\n\"Yea,\" I said. \"I know Marilyn Stoop. I coached her kid. Look at those thunderheads. I think they''re coming our way.\" Why can''t women keep their mouths shut about their excursions off the reservation? It was just one afternoon. Not even the night. And, that was five or six years ago.\\r\\nEveryone thought I was a saint because I never talked about sex very much. In an almost imperceptible way, I displayed disdain toward my three golf buddies because of their women problems. I was above all that.\\r\\nOkay, it''s hard to be perfect. My wife was on a trip with her girlfriend to Alaska, on a cruise ship, for ten days. I was lonely. I was horny. I wanted to be young again.\\r\\nAt three o''clock on a Monday afternoon, Marilyn Stoop and I were the only two in the 19th Hole Lounge. Lisa had already served me two beers and had served Marilyn Stoop two martinis \"in a bucket, on ice.\" I paid for her second drink.\\r\\nWe talked.\\r\\nWe went to my house.\\r\\nWe fucked.\\r\\nI asked her to stay the night, but she said she had to get home to fix dinner.\\r\\nThat was it. That was all there was. I''ve been a saint ever since, although I still have fantasies about those crazy, elevating nipples.\\r\\n\"How about those nipples?\" asked Tom.\\r\\n\"I''m thinking about my shot, Tom. Would you shut the fuck up?\"\\r\\nWe tied the hole. No blood. Match still even.\\r\\nAt the turn, EdBob and Tom went to the snack bar, and Larry and I went into the pro shop to check on our Tuesday tee time. The assistant pro, Leon, was behind the counter.\\r\\n\"You have seven twenty-two,\" he told us, before we asked. \"And, tell EdBob his wife rented a cart this morning. Charged it to EdBob. She only had it for fifteen minutes. I''m not going to charge him.\"\\r\\n\"Thanks, Leon,\" said Larry. \"I''ll tell him.\"\\r\\nHOLE #10, PAR 4, 351 YARDS, HANDICAP # 12 NOTE: THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY HOLD. WATER WAY LEFT, FAIRWAY SAN RIGHT, W"ID"E FAIRWAY.\\r\\nTo Tom''s credit he didn''t tell everyone about me and Marilyn Stoop, but now he knew I couldn''t say anything about him. Nothing negative. Nothing about him being a womanizer.\\r\\n\"How come you''re such a womanizer, Tom?\" asked EdBob, as he teed up on the tenth. \"Don''t you get good poon at home?\"\\r\\n\"Jesus,\" said Larry,\" is that all you guys ever talk about? Why can''t we talk about movies or books or cars once in a while?\"\\r\\n\"EdBob can''t read,\" explained Tom. Then he laughed.\\r\\n\"I read,\" said EdBob, \"if there''s something worth reading. All the books Jack gives me are bullshit.\" He looked at me. \"I don''t mean they''re bullshit for you, Jack, but for me they''re bullshit. All the Grisham books are movies. And the other stuff, like 1776, I already know we won the fucking war.\"\\r\\nI don''t blame EdBob. When I read something that fires me up, I want everyone else to be fired up too. It never works. I like a lot of things my golf buds don''t like, and they like a lot of things I don''t like. EdBob does the New York Times crossword puzzle every day. Tom reads the fish report every day and takes overnight trips on boats to catch albacore. Larry is into cars. He just bought a Ferrari. Cost him over one hundred thousand dollars. I like reading books. When I talk about books, when Larry talks about fast cars, when EdBob talks about his crosswords, when Tom talks about fishing, everyone ends up telling every one else to shut the fuck up and play golf. Maybe that''s why the major topic of conversation always reverts to pussy. All of us agree that pussy is a good thing. Some of us still like it. Some of us can only think back to the time when it was our religion.\\r\\n\"I get good poon at home,\" said Tom, before teeing off and pulling his ball way left and almost into the water. \"Why would you even ask such a dumb question, EdBob?\"\\r\\n\"Just wondered why you''re out chasing poontang all the time.\"\\r\\nBack in the cart EdBob said to me, \"Tom''s pretty fucked up, and he doesn''t know how fucked up he is.\"\\r\\n\"We''re all a little fucked up, EdBob,\" I said.\\r\\n\"I''m not,\" said EdBob. \"Not when I get things worked out with Cindy.\"\\r\\n\"I''d like to win this hole,\" I said. \"I like our chances. Tom''s in trouble over there by the water. I think I felt a rain drop.\r\n\"\\r\\nEdBob''s second shot was ugly. It never got off the ground, but it rolled and rolled and stopped just off the front of the green. \"I like it,\" said EdBob. \"Easy par from there.\"\\r\\nMy second shot was a good one. It landed on the green and rolled about fifteen feet past the hole. I would have a downhill putt for birdie.\\r\\nLarry shanked his second far right and almost out of bounds. \"Fuck me blue,\" he shouted, as he slammed his six iron into the turf. \"I hit these great in practice.\"\\r\\nTom hit into the water and started pouting again.\\r\\nEdBob and I won the hole to go one up.\\r\\nHOLE #11, PAR 5, 496 YARDS, #2 HANDICAP, NOTE: HIT SECOND SHOT OVER WATER, OR PLAY IT SAFE AND LAY UP.\\r\\n\"These teams aren''t fair,\" I said to EdBob. \"Too easy for us.\" I made sure I spoke loudly enough for Tom and Larry to hear.\\r\\nTom stopped pouting and became aggressive.\\r\\n\"I''m getting a little tired of your ''I''m above it all'' attitude, Jack,\" said Tom, glaring at me. \"I know you''re not perfect, if you know what I mean.\"\\r\\n\"What does he mean?\" asked Larry, as he followed us to the tee.\\r\\n\"Ask Tom,\" I said. \"Tom knows everything.\" Larry didn''t ask, at least not right then.\\r\\nBack in the cart, after all of us hit acceptable tee shots, EdBob asked me, \"What did Tom mean?\"\\r\\n\"I never know what Tom means. I agree with you; Tom''s fucked up.\"\\r\\nAnd that''s true. I knew he was a mess the day I met him nine or ten years ago. He and I were just a twosome late on a weekday afternoon. We were standing on the same eleventh tee. Suddenly, Tom ran off the tee and hid behind an oleander bush. He stayed there for two or three minutes. When he returned, he teed off, got back into the cart, and said nothing. Because I had just met him, I didn''t inquire as to his behavior, but I was thinking, This guy is pretty fucked up.\\r\\nFinally, he said, \"You probably think I''m pretty fucked up. But, my wife can''t see me here. I think I saw her car coming up the road.\"\\r\\n\"Why can''t she see you?\" I asked\\r\\n\"Because I can never lie to her. I told her I would never lie to her again. I told her that in front of the counselor. So, shit.\"\\r\\n\"Okay,\" I said. And that''s as far as that conversation got.\\r\\nSince then, I''ve gotten to know a lot about Tom, because Tom tells everything. Tom makes a lot of money selling insulation to big housing contractors. When in college he was on the USC golf team. He''s got a love hate thing going with his wife. She looks Asian to me. He and his wife go to marriage counselors. Four or five years ago he fell in love with a girl he met at a sales convention. His wife found out and left him. He was devastated. When he had her name tattooed on his ass, she returned. They are still together, but they still go to a marriage counselor.\\r\\nAs we reached the eleventh green, large, dark clouds gathered over us, and the wind blew off EdBob''s hat and took it fifty yards up the fairway. We were all able to blame our missed putts on the weather. \"Tiger Woods couldn''t putt in this wind,\" said Tom, when he missed his putt.\\r\\nHOLE #12, PAR 3, 130 YARDS, #18 HANDICAP (easiest hole on the course), NOTE: TEE SHOT ACROSS WATER.\\r\\nThe rain became serious as the four of us approached the twelfth tee.\\r\\n\"A little rain never hurt anyone,\" said Larry. \"Rain is like part of nature. We''re meant to thrive in rain.\"\\r\\n\"Jesus,\" said EdBob. He was putting on his rain gear he carried in his golf bag. \"Could we give the touchy feely bullshit a little break?\"\\r\\nThen we saw the first lightning, and moments later heard a horrendous thunder clap.\\r\\n\"I''m getting the fuck out of here,\" said Tom, moving off the tee and toward his cart.\\r\\n\"These things usually last just a few minutes, Tom.\" I said. \"Let''s wait a while. You don''t want to quit just because you''re behind, do you, Tom?\"\\r\\n\"We''re not behind,\" said Tom. Another flash of lightning. The rain increased. More thunder.\\r\\n\"We''d better get out of here,\" said Larry. \"You know what happens if you get struck by lightning?\"\\r\\n\"You guys are pussies,\" said EdBob, in full rain garb, teeing up his ball. The wind blew his ball off the tee.\\r\\nThe next lightning struck an oak tree near the twelfth green. A large limb fell to the ground and smoke rose from the injured tree.\\r\\nEdBob ran to his cart without retrieving his ball that had blown to the back of the tee box. \"Tom''s right,\" he said. \"We''d better go.\"\\r\\nBy the time we got into the 19th Hole Lounge, all of us, except EdBob, were soaked to the skin.\\r\\n\"If it stops, we''re going to finish,\" I said, after sitting down at the bar and asking Lisa to pour me a brandy. Lisa was still my friend, even though she eighty-sixed me for what I said to Toni.\\r\\n\"I''m not going back out,\" said Tom. \"Miller Light, Lisa?\"\\r\\n\"Not until you say please,\" said Lisa, after putting my brandy in front of me.\\r\\n\"Please,\" said Tom.\\r\\nLarry sat to my left and EdBob to my right. Tom sat next to EdBob. I had the best seat, right over the sink. That''s where Lisa leaned over to wash glasses.\\r\\n\"If you don''t go back out, you forfeit the match,\" said EdBob. \"My regular, Lisa, please.\" EdBob''s regular was bourbon and diet coke.\\r\\n\"I''m calling bullshit on that right now,\" said Tom, before taking his first sip of beer.\\r\\n\"That would only be fair, Tom,\" said Larry, after ordering a ginger ale.\\r\\n\"You''re the only man in the whole club who drinks ginger ale,\" said Lisa.\\r\\n\"How is the gay life treating you, Larry?\" asked Tom.\\r\\n\"Don''t start, Tom,\" said Larry. \"You know I''m not queer, don''t you, Lisa?\"\\r\\n\"I know, Larry,\" said Lisa, smiling. \"Tom just babbles.\" She leaned over to wash a glass.\\r\\n\"How did the matches end up, Larry?\" asked EdBob.\\r\\n\"Scorecard got pretty wet,\" said Larry after sipping his ginger ale. \"I think EdBob and I won the first six holes when we were playing Left and Right\" Larry was dabbing the soaked scorecard with a paper napkin.\\r\\n\"I didn''t think we were ever playing Left and Right,\" I said.\\r\\n\"We were playing Partners,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"Not until the seventh hole,\" said Larry. \"I thought that was when we switched.\"\\r\\nEdBob said, \"Am I the only guy who can keep anything straight around here? We were playing Wolf.\"\\r\\n\"I''m not paying,\" said Tom, as he finished his beer. \"And, I''m going home. See you boys next Saturday,\" said Tom, patting each of us on the back before leaving.\\r\\n\"Talk about your poor losers,\" said EdBob, after Tom left. \"Give me another, Lisa?\"\\r\\n\"I''m out of here, too,\" I said, after tossing down the last of my drink. \"What''s our time for next week?\"\\r\\n\"He''ll call,\" said EdBob, nodding at Larry.\\r\\n\"I''ll call everyone,\" confirmed Larry.\\r\\nWhen I got the parking lot, the rain had stopped.\r\n', 'A Saturday Round of Golf by Michael J.

Her neighbor, Lara, volunteered to help her in the garage this spring morning for the sale, so Elizabeth let her pile the boy''s clothing and re-write some of the prices she''d written earlier on masking tape and little cardboard signs. She didn''t know what price at all to put on some items.\\r\\nShe straightened, tucked, folded every size from infant to eight. She didn''t mind it, but she should sit down because she felt so drained, she only took time today to put on an old house dress that came to her calves. Her stockings were still rolled down to her slippers, and her hair straggled over the creases in her forehead. She knew she didn''t look perky, but what could you expect after all this? It was a lot of work preparing for-- Still, she had to get rid of the stuff, and it seemed better to sell it rather than give it all away. Not for the money, no. But the words, \"get rid of\" bothered her, like it didn''t matter.\\r\\n\"Am I doing the right thing?\" Elizabeth asked her neighbor.\\r\\nLara was holding a small blanket to her face, as if she weren''t sure she should put the price tag on it. \"It''s so soft,\" she said, smiling. \"But yes, to answer your question. It''s the right thing to do. Remember, it''s just a little sale. But are you sure you want to sell this, Elizabeth?\"\\r\\n\"Yes. And that riding toy over there.\" She pointed. \"I saved everything I could. There''s no more room.\"\\r\\nThey heard a screech, and Elizabeth looked anxiously to see who stopped so suddenly in front of the house. A man climbed down from his truck, shoved his hands deep into his pockets, and studied the bicycle Elizabeth had for sale on the lawn. It looked like new. Elizabeth had fixed it--new tires, spokes, paint--\\r\\n\"What do you want for this?\" the man asked, kicking the tires.\\r\\n\"The price is listed,\" Elizabeth said. She pressed her lips together. Why''d he feel he had to kick the tires? What did that tell him?\\r\\nHe peered at the tag hanging over the handlebars. \"One-hundred and twenty-five dollars? That''s more than the cost of a new one!\"\\r\\n\"It''s better than new.\"\\r\\n\"You won''t come down at all?\"\\r\\nElizabeth ambled inside the garage and busied herself behind a table, re-arranging some of the other items she had for sale--a deck of cards, a board game, an old football.\\r\\nLara touched her arm, glanced at the man beside the bike and back at Elizabeth.\\r\\n\"What do you want, lady, the moon?\" the man said, coming into the garage.\\r\\n\"One-hundred dollars,\" Elizabeth said. \"That''s the lowest I can come down.\"\\r\\n\"Look, I''ll give you ninety-five. Ninety-five dollars. That''s only five dollars'' difference.\"\\r\\n\"So what''s five more then?\"\\r\\n\"I can buy a brand new bike for less! Down at the discount store, I can buy one for sixty-nine right now. On sale.\"\\r\\nShe turned her back to him, pretended to take something down off the wall. \"Then buy it.\"\\r\\n\"All right. I''ll give you ninety-eight.\"\\r\\n\"It''s worth more. Much more.\"\\r\\n\"Listen,\" he said, handing her a card with his telephone number on it when she turned around, \"if you change your mind--\" He started to walk away, out onto the lawn.\\r\\n\"Wait.\" Elizabeth followed him to the lawn. She thought, he''s a businessman who''ll resell for twice as much and make a profit off a poor...\\r\\nA car tore down the street--and Elizabeth''s hands flew to her cheeks. Children were playing baseball in the street. She held her breath, heard shouts and a screech of brakes, then the motor gunning again. She strained her eyes. The children moved to the front yard to play now. Elizabeth breathed a sigh of relief.\\r\\n\"You have my number,\" the man said. \"I''ll be waiting for your call.\"\\r\\n\"I changed my mind.\" She was still watching the children down the street. \"I don''t want to sell it now. Not at all.\" She returned to the garage. Especially not to you, she almost said.\\r\\nThe man ran his hand over the bike''s smooth red paint, tapped the seat.\\r\\n\"I wouldn''t touch that bike if I were you, Mister,\" Lara said, \"not at any price.\"\\r\\nHe shrugged. \"But what''s the matter with her? I''m offering a reasonable amount--a good price. What''s the matter with her that she can''t come down a bit?\"\\r\\n\"She''s already come down as low as she can.\"\\r\\n\"Lady--\" He ignored Lara, reappeared in the garage where Elizabeth was looking for a chair to sit on. \"Lady, your last asking price was one-hundred dollars. I''ll give you ninety-nine dollars, and that''s my final offer. Take it or leave it.\"\\r\\nThe blood rushed to Elizabeth''s face, and she clenched her fists until they whitened. She raised her fists at him, shook them out like someone clutching a steering wheel. The man backed away.\\r\\nLara guided the bike into the garage and grasped the door handle. \"We''ll find room,\" she said.\\r\\nElizabeth let her tired arms drop. She paced toward a door that led into the house, then turned around and followed the man to his truck. She wanted to explain to him, if she could explain. But he''d already jumped into his truck. He screeched his tires, and drove off in a huff.\\r\\nElizabeth flinched. \"You be careful!\" she called. She pointed down the street where a ball had rolled.\\r\\nShe came back to the garage. \"He was a good boy,\" she said to Lara. \"My son. He was a good boy.\" She lowered her head.\\r\\n\"Of course he was,\" Lara said.\\r\\nElizabeth shook her head back and forth. \"I didn''t mean it.\"\\r\\n\"I know. I know.\" Lara patted her arm.\\r\\n\"It was an accident. I didn''t see him.\" She waited a moment, listening for something, then shuffled into the house.\\r\\n<em>Carol Lemley (aka Vinci) has published fiction in many magazines, including in Chapter I, GWLitMag, Newsart, The Ultimate Writer, Freeway, and Frontier Magazine.

(20, 1, '2020-08-13 01:16:52', '2020-08-13 09:16:52', 'I was, I suppose you could say, in a PREpartum depression.\\r\\nIt started when my wife, Connie, decided it was time to have a baby. I was thirty-one and she was twenty-eight, a circumstance which I reminded her in my argument against the idea was no cause for alarm. But after she''d voiced her ambition--and thereby made it real to herself--the achievement of motherhood became an obsession for her and she would not leave me alone about it. Finally, after several months, my reluctance to enlist in her project compelled her to resort to a not so veiled threat: \"Steven,\" she said. \"Either we have a baby now or I''m going to leave you.\"\\r\\nAll right, I told her, get off the fucking Ovril then.\\r\\nNow it wasn''t that I never wanted a baby, and not that when I had one I didn''t want it to be with Connie. Strong of character and will, nurturing, quick-witted and sometimes astonishingly perceptive (not to mention pretty), Connie was a terrific wife and more than qualified to be an exceptional mother. The notion of one day having a family with her was hardly repugnant to me.\\r\\nNo. What troubled me when the prospect became imminent--what troubled me immensely--was a consequence inherent in the making of a baby, a consequence that I could not stop recognizing. Fathering a child would tie me into the hideous plan that Creation has devised for everything corporeal. I would be, and by my own hand, replacing myself. Once the deed was done, once I had accomplished the only thing we know with any certainty Creation wants of us, I would be, in Creation''s estimation, expendable.\\r\\nIf Connie, born Catholic but now earnestly New Age in her faiths and sentiments, soothed her fear of death by believing in reincarnation, I was a secular Jew and so had only the void to anticipate. And if I''d always been keenly tuned to the price of existence, and lived in a perpetual state of medium-grade anxiety as a result, my heightened appreciation of my mortality destroyed any semblance of internal equilibrium I could claim. With Connie''s demand the sinister underside of nature had turned itself toward me and it wouldn''t turn away. Indeed, my now hyper-consciousness of what it ultimately meant to be alive made any vista of extravagant pullulation, albeit as manicured as Central Park, grotesque to me. On the most festive of occasions I would see what William James saw--\"the skull grinning in at the banquet.\" And I understood as well what Burroughs meant by \"Naked Lunch.\" When I ate I saw exactly what it was--theflesh--on the end of my fork.\\r\\nI was also, much of the time, in a small rage about the new burden I''d be taking on. I''m referring not to the responsibility of child raising per se, but to the fact that no matter how large was the contempt I''d developed for humanity over the years, having a child would force me to care about what the world might be like after I died.\\r\\nThoroughly upended, I even began to think about homosexuality; about, that is, the solution it afforded to the problem of getting your rocks off without spinning what Kerouac called the \"wheel of the quivering meat conception.\" Though a less than appealing option for me, there were hours when, oddly and perversely, I could not help but feel...well...TITILATED by the concept of having sex that was unencumbered by procreative implications.\\r\\nIn the petrifying absence of contraception I found myself avoiding sex with Connie. And when I could not avoid it my performance was impeded by occlusions in my circuits that would leave the both of us in a condition of considerable frustration. Worse, my very biology joined in the protest forcing me to suffer the embarrassment of a sperm count that a lab I visited at Connie''s insistence twice reported was \"virtually negligible.\"\\r\\nCompounding these miseries, locking me deeper into paralysis as it increased my sense of urgency, was Connie''s evident disappointment in me; a disappointment that was evolving into disdain. Terms of endearment like \"honey\" and \"sugar,\" for example, were routinely being replaced by \"washout\" and \"loser.\" In my timorousness I''d become, in her eyes, something less than a man. Recalling her admission to me once that she''d believed that all Jewish men were extraordinary providers and natural born fathers--and having long before disabused her of the former assumption--I knew that I had no choice now but to keep the latter one alive.\\r\\nThen, reasoning that a change of scene might turn the trick, Connie came up with the idea of spending a few days in the country together. When I agreed, she arranged for us to stay with our friend Betsy who ran a little print shop out of her ramshackle house in a Catskill town not far from Kingston.\\r\\nWith Connie''s patience rapidly disintegrating it was, I knew, something like now or never for me and I geared myself as best I could. Scrupulously adhering to a plan we devised--a month of wholesome foods and regimented exercise; no masturbation for a fortnight--I made ready to win a war with myself.\\r\\nBut arriving upstate, I felt like a German soldier must have felt upon arriving at the Russian front. It was the middle of winter, the sky was low and gray, the snowdrifts were thigh-high and the temperature was near to zero. This was not exactly an atmosphere conducive to a successful completion of the undertaking at hand--especially not when in the back bedroom to which Betsy assigned us (and which she used to store old printing equipment and bound stacks of yellowing posters and flyers), you could see your breath and needed to wear a coat.\\r\\nBut as inopportune and unlikely as the setting may have been, it was on our second afternoon there that a child was conceived.\\r\\nI should say, first of all, that I was feeling not a little physically ill--and it wasn''t only that I was on the edge of a cold. A city apartment dweller, I''ve noticed that country people who pay for their own heating oil tend to be flinty about using it, and Betsy was no exception. On this day, however, in a generous but woefully misguided demonstration of support, she had pumped the thermostat up to steam bath levels. The oppressive heat, coupled with an effluvium of musty furniture and nasty chemical compounds, threatened my ability to both keep my lunch AND remain conscious.\\r\\nIn any case, with Betsy at work out front, Connie, after giving me a thumbs up sign, took off her clothes and arranged them carefully over a chair. Deliberately presenting her bottom to me as she bent to the bed to pull away the quilts, she followed this maneuver by abruptly turning around and flopping onto the bed on her back. Then, reaching for a pillow, she propped it under her buttocks and spread her legs.\\r\\n\"Stevie, do you feel it too? It''s as though there''s a spirit hovering near us waiting to be born again.\"\\r\\n\"Great,\" I said, removing my pants. \"I hope it''s the spirit of a heavy-duty bond trader who happened to have a coronary while he was up here for a weekend. Please don''t let it be one of the local yahoos who ran his pickup into a tree.\"\\r\\nI entered her immediately--it had, after all, been two weeks. But just as quickly I knew I was going to wither. My deprived penis''s rote reaction to a welcoming vagina notwithstanding, the gravity of the occasion continued to undermine me. Still, I''d made a compact which I had to honor and I began to leaf through bodies, shuffle through poses, postures and configurations in my personal mental Kama Sutra file--then, starting to panic and sweating obnoxiously--to ransack my memory and imagination. But no one and no thing I could remember or think to want would keep me up, let alone elicit he participation of my gonads. I tried, with my hand, to STUFF it in. I would happily have settled for a premature orgasm.\\r\\n\"Stop.\" Connie said. She squeezed out from under me and, her hair trailing along my chest and stomach, ran her tongue down the length of my torso to the numb thing between my legs.\\r\\nA determined virgin into her early twenties--she had not permitted a man inside her until she was twenty-three--Connie''d had more than a little experience keeping boyfriends with her mouth. In seconds, my mental state notwithstanding, she got it half way up and we tried again. But once more I evacuated her ignominiously and she was obliged to root in me again. Ten minutes must have passed before she raised her head. I was expecting an expression of scorn. Look, I was prepared to say, I''m sorry. This is really out of my hands. But Connie was grinning at me. Crawling backwards a little, she reached her arm under my legs and lifted them until they were almost perpendicular to the bed. Then, holding my haunches up and steady with both of her hands, she lowered her head to my starkly exposed ass and drove her tongue as deep as she could into my rectum. Lingering there for a while, she finally came out from under me and, brushing it against my nostrils en route, brought her mouth to my ear.\\r\\n\"You little Jew bastard,\" she whispered. \"I wish you''d be the lesbian you are right now because what I really want to do is eat your pussy.\"\\r\\nScore one for Connie''s acumen and her resourcefulness in an emergency. \"Harder,\" she was instructing me after no more than a minute had elapsed. \"Go deeper. Yeah! Oh! Splash.\"\\r\\nCody was born nine months later, almost to the day. Nature being oblivious to human expectations of justice and symmetry, he had, contrary to the circumstances of his conception, both a proper allotment of toes and fingers and a countenance that was amazingly genuine in its sweetness and innocence. I mean there was nothing unhealthy or freakish about him, nothing that was even remotely Damien-ish. By every measure he was a wonderful specimen.\\r\\nAnd me? Well, I was worn by then to a physical as well as emotional nub--I lost fifteen pounds during Connie''s pregnancy that I didn''t need to lose. But not dropping dead with Cody''s arrival had a salutary effect on my nerves that was almost immediate. I was still filled with trepidation, of course, but--my panic significantly less clamorous and debilitating, my not so quiet desperation much quieter--it was, relatively speaking, a manageable trepidation.\\r\\nJust days after his birth I was, in fact, as close as I get to all right again.\\r\\n<em>Robert Levin is a former contributor to The Village Voice and Rolling Stone and the coauthor and coeditor, respectively, of two collections of essays about jazz and rock in the ''60s: \"Music & Politics\" and \"Giants of Black Music.\"</em>', 'How To Make a Baby by Robert Levin', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-to-make-a-baby-by-robert-levin', '', '', '2020-08-13 01:16:52', '2020-08-13 09:16:52', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=20', 0, 'post', '', 1),

We were both in our late twenties, we both had wives and small children and were struggling to get through college and on to a better life.\\r\\nWe met in Calculus class and hooked up the first day because it turned out that we were in the wrong Calculus class and shared a bonding moment of embarrassment. For the next three years, until we graduated, we were Ray-and-Bill, never just Ray, never just Bill.\\r\\nI tutored Bill in all his math classes and dragged him through his ignorance to graduation. Bill tutored me in life.\\r\\nA quiet man, Bill taught me that it takes courage to be a father and faith to be a husband. He taught me that I’m not beneath anyone, but it costs nothing to say, “Yes, sir” or “Yes, Ma’am.” He taught me that friends are more precious than things and that the truth is the only currency between friends. He taught me how to love a woman with my eyes, even in a crowded room, and that fish are a gift of laughter.\\r\\nBill was not an outwardly sentimental man, but he understood, and he made me understand, that he was my friend. When we graduated and wound up working at schools a hundred miles apart, we got together as often as we could and took our boys camping and fishing, or cooked out at his house or mine. He definitely taught me the proper way to grill a good steak.\\r\\nJust before Bill died, I hadn’t heard from him in a few months and I had begun to question the genuineness of his friendship. As I stood next to his bed in the hospital, his face ravaged by the stroke, and waited for some word from him, some chance to apologize for not calling him, he taught me with silence the terrible price of love. And when he woke for the last time and asked me with his eyes to please let him go, I learned more about my own selfishness than anyone ever should.\\r\\nAt Bill’s funeral, with hundreds of his students, friends and family filling the tiny church and the grassy parking lot beyond, his widow took my hand and asked me to stand with her at the casket. As countless strangers filed by to pay their last respects, so many of them shook my hand and called me by my name and told me how Bill had always talked about me, and how obvious it was that he had loved and admired me.

Twelve feet tall.\\r\\nI was watching a program on the history channel the other night and a gentleman was showing his magnificent collection of antique guns and swords. He was most proud of a sword from the 19th century that had been made for a man described as “a lighthouse among lamp posts.” The sword was so long that the six foot tall collector couldn’t unsheathe it in one pull. It had belonged to a Kentuckian that was seven feet, nine inches tall. I would very much like to have been that man’s friend.\\r\\nI am a non-hugger and I come from a long line of non-huggers. Growing up, I think the hugging stopped when I was five or six years old. Today, when I visit my mother, we hug, but I have to tell you, she’s so tiny and frail that I’m afraid to hug her with much enthusiasm. I find it very unsatisfying as hugs go, and I don’t think she gets much out of it either.\\r\\nWhen I was very young I used to love her hugs She’d stoop down, wrap both arms around my waist, and hoist me up with a dramatic groan. Then she’d slip an arm under my bottom and I’d fall into her, my tiny, chubby arms around her neck and my face buried into the top of her cotton dress. I have a sense of that memory at least. Maybe more like a memory of a memory, but complete with the smell of her perfume and the warmth of her skin.\\r\\nMy father was, even by grownup standards, a mountain of a man. He was almost six feet tall and well over 200 pounds, wooly and musky, thunderous and jolly. His hugs I do remember directly. He’d stick his huge hands in the pits of my arms and in one effortless move toss me straight up like a rocket, and then catch me with his arms wrapped around my legs on the way down. My belly was always bare and he’d munch and growl and scratch me with his stubbly beard and I’d howl with delight. He laughed so freely and hugged so well. I think he hugged me for several years after my mother stopped.\\r\\nWhat I miss the most about my father’s hugs is the way he smelled. It was a musky, smoky...well, manly smell. It has always been for me the manly smell. I have the same smell, but I rarely catch the odor on myself. Sometimes, in the car on the way to work, I’ll light a cigarette and just for one breath, I’ll catch it: My father’s smell. It’s not just the cigarette. It’s something more. It’s the way the smoke blends with my natural odor and it always makes me think of him. And it always makes me miss him.\\r\\nIt’s been many years since I had a satisfying hug like dad’s. That’s why I wish there were giants.\\r\\nLike that Kentuckian. Men and women of such height and strength that they can take adults like me and hug us like little children. A man about twelve feet tall and stocky, unshaven and wearing a flannel shirt. He could toss me up and plop me down on his knee facing him, bounce me around a while and make me giggle. “Ride ‘em horsie, down-town. Look out, little boy, you fall doooooown!” He’d grab my wrists and fling me backwards until the top of my head bumped gently on the floor, and I’d giggle wildly. I don’t giggle enough these days. Then he’d pull me into a great smothering hug and I’d just grin and breathe in the manly smell.\\r\\nA woman, ten feet tall and full-bosomed, wearing a cotton dress, could pull me to her with soft, flabby arms. She could put one hand on the back of my head and push my face into her neck. Her long, full hair could cascade across my face and tickle my nose as I nuzzle in and she could sing in a whisper some old song about her baby boy. And I could close my eyes and go to sleep, completely surrounded by security and love; safe at last. I’d pay good money to sleep like that again.\\r\\nI’ve never been afraid of giants. The giants I knew in my youth always made me feel special. They always made me feel loved and protected. The giants of my youth, now, as much as then, still make me giggle.

He was dead at forty-four and me ten, but in such a short time he managed to imprint me for life with the image of what it means to be a man.\\r\\nI can still close my eyes and step off every inch of the old building where I attended middle school and high school -- the wooden floors, the impossibly high ceilings, the coat closets and the milk machine. I still see the faces in the class pictures that lined the old auditorium going all the way back to the beginning of time. I see a thousand details and could build it complete from memory, had I such a talent.\\r\\nIt seems odd that I remember a building from so many years ago in such detail, but not a soul that walked its musty halls with me. Surely I had my first kiss there, my first taste of innocence, my first smell of nervous sweat. Surely there I learned to negotiate with my fists and tasted my own blood in my mouth. There have to be dozens of teachers and fellow students, and at least that many events, that I should remember with great fondness, but I don''t. They are lost to me, like pennies fallen between the floor boards. All, that is, except one. There is one memory that I wish had died with the rest. One memory that has haunted me all these long years.\\r\\n###\\r\\nMy father was a philosopher and a poet, and a first-rate musician. Mother called him a dreamer, but she always said it with approval in her eyes. He had been born to a settler, a genuine “Sooner,” the year of the Oklahoma land rush, and was raised barefoot and without formal education. In 1907, on his 17th birthday and the year of Oklahoma statehood, Father and his younger brother Jimmy hid in a boxcar full of orange crates and cotton bales and rode three days to California . Though Father never spoke of it, that trip became legend to me and my younger brother Tom and neither one of us ever tasted an orange in our own house while our father was alive.\\r\\nHis many adventures had ultimately led Father back to Oklahoma , to the land his parents had settled, where he intended to spend his days with his sons, raising worms and asparagus, and his nights playing music with his brother in the club they owned in Tulsa .\\r\\nFor my 10th birthday, Father made fishing poles out of bamboo, and he and I and Tom spent the day on the banks of the Kiamichi River which ran through the middle of the family property. He told stories that day and played his violin while my brother and I fished for Perch and threw stones across the river. We ate bologna sandwiches and napped side-by-side in the sun, my brother and I nuzzled beneath Father''s strong arms. When the afternoon heat was more than we could bear, we walked back to our home and told Mother fish stories in the kitchen. That night, when Mother and Father were tucking us into bed, Father asked me if I''d had a good birthday. I told him I had and he told me he was proud of me and that he loved me like worms love the dirt.\\r\\nThe following Saturday, while closing the club for the night, my father and uncle were robbed in the parking lot and then shot to death, their bodies left in the alley behind the building.\\r\\n###\\r\\nTom''s idea had been to wait two years until his 17th birthday when we would go to California together, but as I had just graduated from high school and was eager to leave my life in Oklahoma behind me, I told him I was going alone on my 17th birthday. It was only after he threatened to tell Mother that we agreed to go together on my birthday. I confess that the importance I placed on the time I took this journey shadowed my judgment concerning my brother''s best interests.\\r\\nAnd so, on my 17th birthday, we sat in the alley behind Red Bud Grocery and watched the trains pull slowly through town for over an hour waiting for darkness, smoking cigarettes and silently summoning our courage. When we agreed that we''d hop the next train going west, Tom went in the back door of the grocery and came out carrying a bag of oranges.Tom threw the oranges and his pillowcase of clothes and personal items into the first open boxcar and made the jump easily enough. He was thin and graceful and made everything he did look easy. When I had thrown my things in, I stumbled and had to run a full two blocks before catching up to Tom and the open doorway. He reached down for me and pulled at my collar to help me in the car, and together we rolled to the center of the dirty boxcar and laughed while I caught my breath.\\r\\nWe sat in the open doorway, our legs hanging over the side, and silently watched as everything familiar passed by and disappeared into the night. Soon the familiar landscape of my youth was gone, and as we entered into new territory, I knew in that moment that our lives were forever changed. This was what I had been planning since before Father''s death and I knew I would never see the familiar sights of home again. What I didn''t know at that moment was that believing a thing to be true, however sincerely, did not necessarily make it so.\\r\\n###\\r\\nWe couldn''t sleep for most of that first night and so we passed the time talking about the things we''d miss about home and planning what we would do when we reached California . I had heard that a young man could always find work in the strawberry fields or logging camps and since we were not keen on hard labor, picking strawberries seemed our best option. Some time in the early hours before dawn, we ran out of words and slept.\\r\\nFor breakfast, in honor of our father, we ate oranges. They were warm and sweet, and for a while their smell was stronger than the smell of dirt and oil. We ate nearly half of the bag Tom had stolen and made a contest of spitting the seeds across the length of the boxcar. During the night, the train left Oklahoma , passed through the Texas panhandle, and we were well into New Mexico by midday. When we pulled into Albuquerque and the train stopped, we huddled into the corners of the empty boxcar and prayed no one would discover us there. As we began to roll again, we stood in the open door and marveled at how dirty and dry this part of the world seemed to us. In the short time the train had stopped, the boxcar became unbearably hot, so we stayed in the doorway and let the air cool us.\\r\\nAs we neared the edge of town, and the buildings changed from brick to unpainted wood, we could see men running to hop the train. From both sides of the train, maybe a dozen men altogether, in pairs and alone, clamored for the open doors, few with any possessions to burden them. Finally, as the train neared untenable speed, one last man appeared and ran to catch the very boxcar my brother and I occupied. When he was close enough to reach, Tom grabbed his collar, as he had done mine, and pulled the man safely into the car with us.\\r\\nI had never in my life seen a man as filthy as our new fellow occupant. His clothes were black with soot, as if he''d just come from work in the coal mines, and his face hadn''t been washed in ages, as far as I could tell. When he spoke, he had no teeth and his words were a jumble of curses and unidentifiable sounds more spat than spoke. He was unshaven and his hair unkempt so that he looked as wild as he sounded. Tom and I were speechless, and I know I was more than a little afraid. He mumbled a few more curses, looked around the boxcar, and seeing the bag of remaining oranges, sat down and began eating them.\\r\\nTom, clearly not as afraid as I was, made a motion to stop the man from eating our oranges, but I held him back. Looking outside I judged that the train was now moving too fast to safely jump, so I pulled Tom to the other end of the boxcar and suggested that we should just let the man have the oranges and we''d jump out the first time the train slowed enough. Tom''s suggestion was that we put the man off the train instead. Unable to restrain Tom, I watched as he approached the man.\\r\\nStill sitting, with half an orange in his mouth, our fellow passenger pulled a pistol and pointed it at my brother''s chest. As he pulled the hammer back, he stood, and Tom raised his hands, stumbling backwards, eyes set on the end of the barrel, retreating to stand next to me. Together, we backed to the opposite end of the boxcar and didn''t breathe again until the man sat down and continued eating our oranges.\\r\\nWhat happened next haunts me to this day. I know that soon I will go to my rest and need not have ever told the events of that day, beyond what I reported all those years ago. Because I couldn''t bear to tell my mother what really happened in that boxcar, I''ve carried the terrible secret of cowardice all my long days. I tell it now, not in hope of absolution either in this life or the next, but in confession and payment to that beautiful boy I abandoned in my youth.\\r\\nFor some time the train clanked and rocked its way across the desert wilderness of New Mexico , and Tom and I huddled together and watched the man as he ate everything he could find among our things. When he finished eating, he rummaged through our clothes and, apparently finding nothing that suited him, rose and came toward us, pistol drawn. He pointed it at Tom and motioned for him to stand up. Tom stood, and the man, motioning with the pistol, told him to take off his clothes. Tom at first shook his head and refused, but the man cocked the pistol again, and with my urging, Tom undressed and tossed his clothes on the floor of the boxcar at the feet of the man.\\r\\nAs Tom stood there naked and I sat on the floor behind him, the man undressed, never taking the pistol or his eyes off of us. It wasn''t until he suddenly stepped forward and grabbed Tom by the hair, holding the pistol to my brother''s head, that I realized it hadn''t been Tom''s clothes he was after. I stood suddenly, but the man pointed the pistol and fired, the bullet entering the wooden floor of the boxcar only inches in front of my feet. I watched, paralyzed with fear, as the man forced my younger brother face down onto the filthy floor, with the pistol pressed to the back of his head, and raped him.\\r\\nWhen he finished, and while he was still lying on top of Tom, he released the hammer of the gun. Then, as he pushed up onto his knees, he struck Tom in the head with the barrel and Tom splayed, unconscious. I sank to my knees and wept as the man sat back and cleaned himself with pieces of our clothes he had scattered before.\\r\\nI don''t know how long I knelt there crying, or for whom I was crying most; my brother, so young and so defiled, or myself, now face to face with my cowardice. I don''t know how long the man sat and watched me cry, or how much pleasure he took in it, but eventually he rose and came to me. He stood before me, still naked, and with the gun once again in my face, told me to take off my clothes. In that moment, I lost my sense of immortality. Drained of tears and content to know my life was going to be over soon, I began to remove my clothes. I ripped the buttons on my shirt as I pulled it off, angry that he couldn''t just kill me first. I pulled my undershirt over my head and stood to remove my pants. While I fumbled with my belt and avoided looking at the man who would soon violate me as he had my brother, I saw movement behind him. Tom, so fast it was done before I realized what was happening, grabbed the man and spun him backwards, away from me. The gun exploded and I was deafened. My cheek and ear burned, but the bullet missed me and I saw the gun fall to the floor. I had it in my hand and was turning to help Tom when I saw the man standing in the door, arms flailing for balance. Tom took the gun from my hand, walked over to the man who had recovered his balance, and shot him in the face. The man went limp and fell like a tree out of the boxcar, head first into the gravel below. Above the noise of the train and the ringing in my ear, I could have sworn I heard the man''s neck snap. Maybe I just hear it now.\\r\\n###\\r\\n \\r\\nWe dressed, but we didn''t speak. We sat and cried, but we didn''t speak. I held Tom as he wailed and together we paced the boxcar and cried. Tom, in a fit of anger, threw all the man''s clothes out the door and kicked the half-eaten oranges, but still we didn''t speak. Finally, as we sat with our legs hanging over the side, I said I was sorry. I said I was sorry, I was so sorry, but Tom only cried and said nothing. He turned and leaned against the side of the door, one leg still over the side, the other he bent and hugged to his chest. I couldn''t see his face for a long time, but when he finally raised it, his mouth was open in a silent scream, his agony undiminished. I said again I was sorry and Tom, still screaming without sound, raised the pistol to his temple and fired. Before I could catch him, he fell out the door. His pant leg caught on some piece of the boxcar and his body fell underneath. There was not enough of him left to bury.\\r\\n###\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd now, after all these long years, with this my only clear memory of my brother Tom, it''s my turn.

The slit they call a window is a good six feet above the cool stone beneath my feet. I’d be able to look straight out of it if I weren’t restricted by the chains. I’m sitting four feet away by an old steel bed, just thinking, watching the day’s light ebbing away. I wonder for a moment if I’ve made a mistake, that maybe it’s going to take longer than I have. The walls are three feet deep, judging by the window ledge. The door is solid iron, bolted from the outside, and there are long rusty chains binding both my legs to a bracket in the wall. Escaping seems nearly impossible. Nearly.\\r\\nSome people believe that anything is possible, given the right incentive. Let’s say a man is locked in a cage. He’s warm, he has water, maybe some food. That man’s in no hurry to leave. He figures he has some time to think about his next move. Now stop feeding that man. He gets a little worried, tries to think of a plan. He knows he needs to get out in the next few days, before his strength wanes. Then you take away his fluids. Now he knows he has to get out or he’ll die soon. He starts thinking of ‘when’ rather than ‘how’.\\r\\nNow, tell the man in the cage, who’s tired, starving and thirsty, that you are going to take the life of his wife and child.\\r\\nEven an ordinary man would start clawing and tearing at the walls with his bare hands. An ordinary man would possess the rage and power of ten men, and he would scream and kick and tear at those walls. An ordinary man would fight against those walls until he drew his last breath.\\r\\nAn ordinary man.\\r\\nI have seen every type of prison ever designed. Pits, dungeons, water traps, cages. I’ve seen hundreds of them. From the inside. Now a man has put me in one so he can have my family. I know they won’t let him. I know they’ll fight him, and I know he’ll kill them.\\r\\nSo I know I will get out. There is not even the slightest doubt in my mind. The question is how. \\r\\nI draw one final, calming breath, and begin. It’s nearly black in here now. A rat brushes over my toes and I smile in the blackness. If a rat can come in, I can get out. I pull the chains as far as they’ll go from the wall. They don’t budge, but that doesn’t surprise me. A man has more strength available to him than the strength of his arms. If I could use my legs against the chains I could loosen them up a little. If I could also put my whole body weight against them I’d be in business.\\r\\nI carefully wrap one of the long chains around the strongest steel bedpost. It’s not as strong as I’d like, but it’ll hold. Now the chain holding my right arm to the wall is no longer doing its job. It’s linking the wall to the bedpost and the bedpost to my arm. The bed is braced to the cold floor slabs and creaks only slightly as I climb onto it. Maybe it’s sturdier than I thought. \\r\\nI leap as high as the chains will allow and bring all 220lbs of my bodyweight smashing down onto the chain. My body is jarred with the collision, and a flash of pain shoots through my foot, along my spine and spears into the base of my skull. I lose my footing in the very same instant and crash awkwardly onto my back . For a moment all I see are bright purple lights, and I have to bite my bottom lip hard to make sure the world doesn’t swim away. The taste of blood feels good in my mouth, and I get back onto the bed. \\r\\nThe chain is still very much attached to the wall, but there’s now a sliver of black between steel and stone. I leap even higher, and as I fall I kick downward with both feet, like a kid stomping in a puddle. Again, the shooting pain from the base of my feet. The chain gives a little this time, and I manage to steady myself against the wall. I just stand there, breathing in and out, swaying on the creaking chain. A bead of sweat rolls down the side of my face, and I notice a single, solitary star, winking at me through the window grate. Time’s moving on Jack, back to work.\\r\\nThe wall bracket has been hauled out maybe an inch now. I calculate three foot of wall, standard bolt of around a foot and a half. Seventeen inches to go. I wrap the chain around my right arm and use my left to grab the bracket. I take a deep breath, and lunge backward with all my might. Nothing. Not a creak. \\r\\nScrew you. \\r\\nI unwrap the chain from the bedpost. I run perpendicular to the bracket, hauling the chains behind me, like an ox ploughing the field. I nearly break my wrist when the chains reach the end of their slack, but I don’t feel any give in the chain. So I go the opposite way, running with the chain, and jolting the bracket to the right. Like working something side to side, but very slowly, with more purpose, more power. I go back to the bracket and try and jiggle it again. I’m about ready to try the bedpost again, when a tiny wedge of the stone wall closest the bracket chips off under the pressure. \\r\\nIt wakes me from my trance, and I notice that my knuckles are bleeding from contact with the wall. Outside, the star has moved a quarter width of the window, and winks flirtatiously.\\r\\nI turn my attention back to the wall bracket. I wrap the chain around my arm twice, and pull with all my strength. At first there is nothing, but then steadily, like pulling something heavy from thick, deep mud, I feel the bracket grate against the wall, and it squeals out perhaps two further inches. This boosts my adrenaline levels and I place my foot against the wall, and I pull against that chain with everything I have. Sweat floods down my face, and my whole body burns with effort. The bracket holds for a few seconds then finally and reluctantly screeches out, and I crash onto my back on the hard floor. I lift my arms in front of my face as the heavy rod, bracket and length of chain fall on me.\\r\\nI am now a free man in a small room.\\r\\nFor maybe four or five minutes, I lie on my back, the rod in my hands, just thinking, planning. There were two reasons for pulling the rod out of the wall rather than breaking the chains at the wrist. Number one was the timescale. It would take nearly double the time to release both wrists. Sure, I’m now trailing around ten feet of chain, but I’m mobile. Second reason was for this rod I have in my hands. Nothing in the whole cell is as strong as this eighteen inch piece of fat steel. Not the bedposts, not the chains, not the bars on the window, not the bolt on the door. \\r\\nNot even the door itself is as thick as this rod I now have in my hand, working with me instead of against me. I pull myself up onto my haunches, and glance one last time out the window. My lucky star has gone, but in its place are a dozen more, twinkling and smiling at me. I smile right back at them as I tighten my grip on that rod and I turn my back on those stars. My family needs me, and I have work to do.\\r\\nEscaping had seemed nearly impossible.

She pulled her face up against the wet glass, her weight pushing down through her straight arms on to the sill as she balanced on the tip of her toes, resting on the edge of her heavy shoes'' rubber soles. The cold and the snow and the ice seemed to disappear as she peered inside.\\r\\nThe lights were stars in a display of old toys, wispy glints in the sky above a circus parade getting ready to board a huge rust-dented steam ship. Elephants lead the way, their cardboard tusks carving forward as their paper trunks wiggled in the air, proclaiming their exotic music. Next came monkeys, twelve in a row, with long arms past their feet and small red fezzes perched between their big ears; and then there was the ringmaster, round as a pumpkin, and just as bright.

The phone calls had been bad enough.\\r\\nThe dream takes place in a diner – all-American. I’m sitting at the counter on one of those blood-red vinyl stools they have. I can’t get comfortable and keep slipping and having to readjust myself, worming my way back up the sleek, sheer plastic. The diner is lit so brightly that its walls seem to be throbbing. The spotty, stainless steel knives and forks and napkin dispensers hum with reflected light, so brightly that I find it hard to keep my eyes open and have to blink against them constantly. There is a waitress behind the counter. Her skin is so pale that I can make out nothing but the big, blue almonds of her eyes and even those are obscured by the intermittent smoke screen of her break time Pall Mall. She ignores the pinging summons of the short-order bell. I can neither keep my eyes open nor closed, it’s disorienting and frustrating. My eyeballs itch.

Same weight and hair (receding and gelled back into a rocker-style duck’s-ass) but without his glasses. He is wearing a black, Members Only jacket and turned-up black jeans. He looks straight down into his plate, left a jaundiced white by the yolk of a long-gone fried egg, and runs a crust of bread round and round the rim. For the first time ever, he seems cooler than me. He doesn’t look up when he speaks nor does he stop mopping his plate. I don’t even see his lips move.\\r\\nCan you believe it?\\r\\nI cannot answer his question. I don’t know what he means and, besides, I have my mouth full. There is a cam-corder on the counter in front of Ross that I hadn’t noticed before, one of the older models: about the size of a lunch box with a long eye piece and manual focus in a reassuring black. The tiny red light on the top of the top of the camera is blinking but it is pointed catatonically toward itself, reflected in the long mirror behind the lunch counter (you can watch yourself while you are eating).\\r\\nI saw everything, Carter. I got their number.\\r\\nI want to say something that the waitress will overhear and be impressed by. I want to cut Ross down like we used to at school. I chew faster and breathe harder but now find I can’t swallow at all, that I can’t remember how. I begin to worry that I will never finish this mouthful and will never be able to speak again.\\r\\nYou’ll never see those the same way again.\\r\\nI look down. It takes effort to keep my burning eyes open for long, I can see only in patches through glare and welling tears. There on my picture perfect plate, next to the bun and fries, is a whole pickle. The pickle is a dark, verdant green and is grotesquely studded with warty bumps. It shines with grease in this light and moves with a blind, maggot-like writhe. I wake up, hard.\\r\\nI blame the dream for making me late for work. And for my skipping lunch that day.\\r\\n* * *\\r\\nRoss Wells is not registered with Classmates.com. He is in my old yearbook, with the quote: “Who Watches the Watchmen?” and a teased-up, gothed-out pompadour that makes me laugh out loud.\\r\\nAm I really at the point of believing that my high school days were a kinder, simpler time? Surely in today’s schools a kid like Ross would be yanked from class, shot full of Paxil and called to account for his Charlie Manson t-shirt and Poli-Sci papers on the CIA starting the A"ID"S virus. Wouldn’t he be counseled, diagnosed, medicated until the black trench coat gave way to a backwards baseball cap and the Anne Rice books to a can of Mountain Dew?\\r\\nOur class was self-diagnosing. Cruelty is remarkably therapeutic. Instead of red Post-Its in a case-worker’s inbox, Ross was tagged by his peers, with names and spit-balls: Ross-putin. That was one of mine that stuck, but not the worst. Still, poor old Ross didn’t get the worst ration of shit at LBJ, not by a long shot. Everyone got to take a bite out of that sandwich at one point or another and everyone has their high school crosses to bear. Even I endured my share of wedgies and smack downs. It prepares you for life.\\r\\nIt is amazing what you can justify, looking back.\\r\\n* * *\\r\\nI have the same dream again that night. Only this time Ross and I sit together in one of the booths against the brightly lit diner’s back wall. That red vinyl creaks and farts every time I move and sometimes when I don’t, I dread seeming rude, but there is barely any space between the seat and the edge of the table. It presses into the bottom of my ribcage and pushes me against the back of my seat like I’m caught in a mummy’s tomb.\\r\\nRoss is explaining something to me, a message that I will have to repeat back to him before I can leave to deliver it, but I am paying no attention. My head feels heavy. Or my neck is noodle-weak. I cannot lift my gaze up to meet his and take in the important information he is imparting. I try to brace myself against the table’s edge and make a space to breathe into.\\r\\nCan you believe it? My days are numbered. That’s it for me.\\r\\nThe waitress is standing at the edge of our table. I cannot describe a single feature of her face and her notebook and pen are poised and sinister. She does not speak. I am beginning to catch a little more of Ross’ spiel:\\r\\nA phone rings. A door knocks. The car that pulls alongside you in the street. They’re not looking for a parking space. No. That’s it for me.\\r\\nTonight I know I’m dreaming. I even remember something I had read a long time ago about lucid dreaming: that once you realize you are in a dream you can control it. But I can’t even think of anything interesting to say back to Ross (how rude), let alone steer this towards the Hollywood sex orgy I had hoped for after reading that article.\\r\\nCarter, they’re out to get me. I’m going to the papers. That’s what I’m trying to say. They’re out. To get me.\\r\\nI am looking down at the primary colors of ketchup, mustard, salt and pepper arranged on the table top like Queen’s Gambit Declined.\\r\\nThe buzzing dentist’s drill is there again and this time an inch away from my ear. My fear is distilled into anger that overcomes manners and I struggle into a stare to say:\\r\\n“Fuck off, Ross. Why don’t you just fuck off?” it is my dream, after all. Who’s to know?\\r\\nI can hear that country song again. Then the bell that dangles from the inside of the doorframe sounds, the tin sound ricochets off all four walls and back again as the door closes with a decisive clap. The waitress turns her head to see who just came in.\\r\\nI wake up sweating and gasping like a TV Vietnam vet. I decide to return Ross’ calls.\\r\\n* * *\\r\\nHe answers the phone by lifting it wordlessly to his ear.\\r\\n“Hello? Hello? Uh, Ross?”\\r\\n“This is he.”\\r\\n“It’s Carter. From high school. Just returning your call from the other day.”\\r\\n“Calls. But thanks for getting back to me, Carter. I was hoping I could count on you.”\\r\\n“Yeah. So what’s up? What’re you doing?”\\r\\n“Nothing. Just waiting.”\\r\\n“Oh yeah? Waiting for what?”\\r\\n“The phone. The door. However it’s going to go down.”\\r\\nThat’s a pretty sinister statement to make to a classmate you haven’t kept in touch with but I find myself more annoyed for his tendency to speak like a character from a TV show. His voice is light and blasé; it has the assurance of a film geek about to crush a civilian at the Star Wars edition of Trivial Pursuit.\\r\\n“So, I got your voice mail. What’s up?”\\r\\n“You’re in journalism, right, Parker?”\\r\\n“Not really – publishing. Educational CD-ROMs.”\\r\\nHe laughs: “I got something educational for you. Something that’s got to get out, it’ll blow the whole lid off of everything.”\\r\\n“What’s that?”\\r\\nI know he is going to say a tape.\\r\\n“A tape. Cam-corder. I saw everything. You won’t believe it.”\\r\\n“A tape of what? Isn’t that more of a TV thing?”\\r\\n“They have the TV. TV is suicide. You have no idea what I’m talking about, do you? Zapruder? Rodney King? The Alien Autopsy shit? Sound familiar? This is bigger than all that put together. I’m not going to go into it on the phone, Carter. Can you going to help me? Yes or no?”\\r\\n“Take it easy, Ross. Where are you, anyway, where is Area Code 775?”\\r\\n“I asked you a question. Yes or no?”\\r\\n“I’m not saying no. I don’t know. I mean,I don’t know what you’re talking about, man. Can you hear that clicking? Is that just on my phone?”\\r\\n“That’s them. They could be here at any second, Carter. My days are numbered. I know that. I accept that. This is the life I chose. But if I can get this tape out it will all be worthwhile. I’ll win. That’s where you come in.”\\r\\n“Who? Who’s going to be there? Cops? Just try and relax.”\\r\\nHe laughs again, higher pitched this time:\\r\\n“I’ll tell you who: Them. The original Them. The Men in Black.”\\r\\n“Johnny Cash is coming to get you?”\\r\\n“Men. Plural. And no one knows who they are: spooks, grays. It doesn’t matter. I do know that they are coming. Soon. Yes or no, Carter?”\\r\\n“It’s not that I don’t want to help, Ross. Let’s just back up for a second, you sound pretty frazzled. What exactly do you want me to do? Is there someone I can get in touch with?”\\r\\n“Don’t talk to me in that social worker voice, Carter. Jesus, I’m not having an ‘episode’ or whatever you think it is. This is real.”\\r\\n“I’m sorry, man. I just don’t see what I can do.”\\r\\n“You know what? Don’t worry about it for now. It was a long shot anyway. Hey, do you still keep in touch with Jenny Blanton?”\\r\\nThat’s pretty much it. I hang up the phone and spend the rest of the day Googling for Paranoid Schizophrenia.\\r\\n* * *\\r\\nIf I were ever granted access to a time machine my first trip would be back to 1991 to kick my own 17-year-old ass. My music collection alone would justify the beating.\\r\\nI wasn’t a bully at school; I wasn’t high enough up the pecking order. I was, however, very keenly aware of those beneath me in the Social Darwinian Crab Pot of Lyndon Baines Johnson High. The dandruff jokes, the nick-names, the thumb-tacks on his chair all washed over Ross like so much squid ink. The tortures I devised were, I suppose, the least of his worries.\\r\\nI haul the yearbook out again but the more I look, the more I see past the hair crimes and clip-on bow ties, to Ross: nose bleeding in the locker room, straining to get back his poems as they’re read to laughter in Algebra II, picking athletic tape from his eyebrow with his tears a cocktail of stinging rage and shame.\\r\\nHe never kicked my ass. Not for all the redemption, the status, the revenge or the ease with which he could have done it. I wish he had.\\r\\n* * *\\r\\nI have the dream again. And again we are seated in the booth. This time with clean plates and empty glasses in front of us. It feels odd that I am still hungry. Ross has the check and is paying his share out of one of those big skater wallets that you chain to your pants. By the time he puts it back in his pocket there is a neat pile of bills laid cross-wise on the green tab of the check in the center of the table.\\r\\nThis time there is no itching in my eyes or weight in my head or trouble breathing or dentist’s drill. I am staring straight ahead at Ross and while it does occur to me that it’s rude to stare, I don’t feel bad. I don’t feel bad until Ross says:\\r\\nI made you a copy. And I put it in the mail.\\r\\nHe stands up to leave and I realize there are people waiting for him in the doorway. I don’t know how I realize this and I have my back to the door, so I can’t see who, but they are there. The waitress is still at the foot of our table, as Ross moves past her to leave she extends her arm and caresses his cheek with a gesture that turns me on and fills me with jealousy and I am acutely aware of how much I hate Ross and how much I have always hated him.\\r\\nI look down at the money on the table and know instantly that he has stiffed me on the tip. The realization that he is gone and I have forgotten my wallet wake me up, in a horror-movie sweat again.\\r\\n* * *\\r\\nI don’t have a camcorder and it’s one of those funny half-tapes that you can only play on one of the older models, so it’s been sitting on my coffee table since it arrived with yesterday’s stack of junk and bills. By now, whatever the tape will reveal is beside the point, anyway.\\r\\nI can’t get through to Ross. The number he gave me just turns up that hideous three-note screech and the mocking voice of the computerized woman who tells me the number is no longer in service or has been disconnected.\\r\\nMy phone has rung every hour, on the hour. Nothing shows up on the caller "ID" and there is no one there when I answer, although I do keep answering. What is more embarrassing than saying: “Hello? Hello? Hell…lo?” to a dead line?\\r\\nI could have said yes or no. Or sorry. I could have bought him a drink at the reunion.\\r\\nThat black Cadillac has been parked by the hydrant across the street since this morning.\\r\\nI have that cold feeling now in my stomach, the dentist’s drill is there behind my eyes. I slouch on the couch and stare at the tape, wishing it away, wishing things different.\\r\\nThe doorbell rings one, long ring.', 'Men In Black by Tony Phillips', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'men-in-black-by-tony-phillips', '', '', '2020-03-31 10:06:34', '2020-03-31 18:06:34', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=29', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(30, 1, '2020-04-01 10:21:07', '2020-04-01 18:21:07', 'What am I going to say to Ellen? How will she react when I tell her I''ve been fired? I suppose there''s no point in asking myself rhetorical questions. I know exactly what she''s going to say.\\r\\n\"Howard, how could you let this happen? How are we going to pay our bills? I''m extremely disappointed in you. You''ve always been such an underachiever. You always settle for second best from yourself. I bet you''ve been daydreaming, or hallucinating, or whatever you want to call it, instead of focusing on your work. Didn''t any of what Dr. Seagram had to say sink in? I suppose not. To think of what I gave up for you. I could be married to Barry Frugesi, living in a mansion with servants catering to my every need. But no, like a fool I let emotion override common sense and chose you. Now here I am closing in on middle age, and instead of being secure, we have to start all over again.\"\r\n<!--more-->\r\nNone of this will be fair of her to say. First of all, I''ve worked my tail off for McDermott and Lynch Realty. It''s not my fault that I''m in a slump. Not entirely, anyway. I can only perform as well as the economy dictates. For a considerable number of years I was their top salesman. At one point I accounted for nearly sixty percent of their sales. There wasn''t a house on the market that I couldn''t sell, even if it was little more than a cardboard box held together by duct tape and loose wiring. Now that I''m not doing so well, do they show me loyalty? I suppose it was pure folly to expect any. Loyalty has gone the way of chivalry and penny arcades.\\r\\nBackstabbing from employers is one thing, but the reaction from Ellen that I fully anticipate is shameless. How dare she complain about our bills being paid? We''ve never paid a bill the entire time we''ve been married. I''ve paid the bills. I''ve single handedly supported my family from day one, never mind that gratitude has been expressed at a faster dwindling rate than marital affection over the past decade or so. My output at work has declined by no less a degree than Ellen''s output in the bedroom, not that bringing this up will strengthen my case any. Ellen is living a comfortable existence courtesy of my earning and investing efforts, but all she cares to highlight are my supposed inadequacies. Her complaints are based on the paranoia instilled in her youth by a penny-pinching father. The truth of our situation is that we''d need the Hubble telescope to find the poorhouse she''s routinely prophesying is one bad break away from becoming our residence. As for the legend of Barry Frugesi, if she throws him in my face one more time I''ll have no choice but to sternly express that - \"He was a pompous, self-centered ass, not to mention that it was he who dumped you, Ellen. And I hate to be the bearer of bad news, darling, but you left middle age behind in your rear view mirror a few years ago.\"\\r\\nWhat am I doing? I''m walking down the street talking to myself, that''s what I''m doing. I need to get a grip. It''s a good thing this is Greenwich Village or else I would be attracting a lot of stares. As it is, I''m just one more raving lunatic in the crowd. This area of the only city I''ve ever lived in, the greatest city in the world, bares little resemblance to the way it was when I was a child. That was before NYU moved in and took over, gentrifying the neighborhood building by building. Times in general have changed a great deal from when I was young and on top of the world. I suppose everyone''s on top of the world when they''re young, and by its very definition, times have little choice but to change. Still doesn''t stop me from fondly reminiscing and profoundly missing days gone by, one of my biggest faults according to Ellen, though certainly not the only one she recites.\\r\\nAs I turn onto Broadway, a beautiful and eerily familiar melody flutters in the air. I spy a black man across the street standing in front of a 24-hour deli playing a tenor saxophone. The scene is typical, but the virtuoso performance he''s giving is anything but. Before my mind can recall where I have heard this song before, he stops and starts to play another one. This composition I instantly recognize as a Dexter Gordon masterpiece that the street musician is interpreting flawlessly. Being a huge jazz fan and having nothing better to do than procrastinating further before heading home to inform Ellen of my unemployment, I cross the street to listen closer.\\r\\nThe sax player looks about fifty-five years old, which would make him five years older than me. He has a salt and pepper afro and possesses a complexion like hot chocolate, his radiantly white teeth putting me in mind of marshmallows floating on top. The feeling of warmth exuded from his eyes puts one instantly at ease in his presence, even as they dance in rhythm with the music he brings forth. His fingers glide across the keys with a fluidity I can''t help but marvel at. Here is a man who was born to play the saxophone, but not on a street corner with an open case lying on the ground next to him containing about three dollars in change. This guy belongs in Lincoln Center or Carnegie Hall. He should be performing for kings and queens, not pedestrians with too much on their minds and too little spare time to recognize the genius they''re racing past.\\r\\nThe music transports me back to a better time, a wondrous one during which I handled a saxophone pretty well myself. I must have played close to a hundred nightclubs. That sax of mine helped pay my way through college. It got me more dates than I could have ever hoped more. Ellen fell in love with me, despite having superior offers on the table, largely because of the passion and sensuality that I exuded on stage. Was it really so long ago when I last went out on the fire escape to set loose a melody after making love to Ellen on that creaky old bed in our tiny apartment in SOHO, back when we were delirious newlyweds?\\r\\nThe Dexter Gordon tune is brought down to a graceful landing. I respectfully applaud and toss a dollar into the musician''s case.\\r\\n\"Much obliged, mister,\" he says in a throaty pack-a-day voice, flashing a broad smile with his practically glow-in-the-dark molars.\\r\\n\"You''re incredible,\" I tell him. \"Much too talented to be out here playing on the street.\"\\r\\n\"Ain''t nothing wrong with the streets. You''re always guaranteed a sell out audience, rain or shine. Even if most people don''t stop to listen, they still hear me as they walk by. All in all I''ve played for thousands of folks. And every so often, one of my songs touches someone''s heart and makes their day just a little brighter. Guys and dolls on Wall Street might make a lot more money than me, but how many opportunities do they get on the job to make someone smile?\"\\r\\n\"I suppose you have a point there,\" I say. \"I used to play the sax years ago. Nothing quite like standing before a crowd and knowing I had them in the palm of my hand, that I could take them on a journey of my own making simply by breathing my dreams and aspirations into that brass tunnel. The feeling was worth a lot more to me than the paychecks.\"\\r\\n\"Of course it was. That feeling is called happiness. A shrink or a thesaurus could give you some alternate words for it, but I think the one I chose works just fine. I might not have a lot of money, but it doesn''t take much effort to put a grin on this old mug of mine. The same can''t be said for you, sorry to report.\"\\r\\nA quizzical expression must fall upon my face, because before I can ask the old musician what he means by this, he proceeds to answer my unspoken question.\\r\\n\"I can see it in your eyes. Your whole life has revolved around providing for the well being of others at the expense of your own contentment. You''ve worked for years in a job you hate so your wife could wear fashionable dresses while dining at exclusive restaurants. You made sure that your son was able to go to the best schools, even though you knew that he''d goof off and flunk out. You arranged for your daughter to have her dream wedding, never mind that you couldn''t stand the guy and accurately predicted it wouldn''t last a year. Their needs were taken care of, but what have you done for yourself? The truth is you haven''t really been happy since the last time you played your saxophone. When you put it up in the attic so your wife would stop complaining that she kept tripping over it, you tucked away a large piece of your soul.\"\\r\\nI can do nothing but stare with astonishment as this complete stranger recounts my life story. I am both frightened and fascinated.\\r\\n\"Where are you getting this nonsense from?\" I manage to stammer, afraid to confess to the accuracy of his words, or perhaps ashamed to admit it to myself.\\r\\n\"Like I said, I can see it in your eyes. It''s a gift. Some people create paintings, some write novels, others sing or dance or solve complicated mathematical equations. There are even a few extraordinary individuals who can juggle while riding a unicycle. As for me, I play the saxophone and read people''s eyes. Some of them tell the saddest stories ever told. The truly tragic ones I put to music and play their tears. It isn''t too late for you to change your song, you know. Sometimes, what looks like a setback is actually an opportunity. Don''t let this one pass you by. Life is too short, and there''s a whole mess of beauty to take in if you have the right frame of mind to see it. Most folks waste time examining their sorrow, trying to make sense of it, trying to bend it to their will. I say just toss it aside to make room for a prettier picture, for a song with a groove that you can dance to.\"\\r\\nI''m not sure how to regard this fortune cookie advice. Since he knows so much about me, superficial details as well as knowledge that seems to require inside information, perhaps he actually is qualified to counsel me. He may merely be some down on his luck guy playing saxophone on a street corner for castaway coins, but his advice rings truer than that given to me by those in much loftier societal positions, including Dr. Seagram, who charged armed robbery by the hour to listen to my woes and then regurgitate the irrelevant opinions of Sigmund Freud. Listening to the musician, mesmerized by the creases in his face that remind me of rivers on a map of Africa, I feel as people do upon reading their horoscope in the newspaper for amusement and finding that it neatly coincides with whatever they happen to be going through.\\r\\nAfter college, I wanted to pursue a full time career in music. But Ellen, who was pregnant with the child who hastened our sprint to the altar, insisted that I enter a more secure line of work. On the recommendation of her father, some would have called it extreme prodding but I knew better than to offend the daughter who doted on him, I chose the real estate game. I turned out to be pretty good at it, needing simply to transfer my stage presence to one-on-one charm, especially in the beginning when it was new enough to capture my interest. But it was only a matter of time before dissatisfaction settled in. My vocation was lucrative, my home spacious, my finances secure, my loved ones were protected from their complacency, but still .\\r\\nOne morning about seven years into our marriage, an impulse led me up to the attic in search of my abandoned saxophone. I found that I had forgotten all the songs once played from memory with such ease. I had traded my soul to the devil in exchange for domestic tranquility, and my soul, in the shape of a tenor saxophone, had become dust covered and foreign to my touch. As I headed to work shortly afterwards, I realized it wasn''t so much playing the sax that I missed, as it was the sense of freedom I associated it with. When I was a young man, the whole world lay before my eyes for the taking. Now as a not so young man, I could scarcely believe how little I had elected to grab hold of.\\r\\nThe process of manufacturing a lifetime is a tiring one, or at least that has been my experience to date. The quotas I was professionally obligated to reach pulled increasingly further away over the years. The degree to which I allowed myself to care about this waned in direct proportion. One year ago I had what experts termed a nervous breakdown. Therapy and time were supposed to rejuvenate me and increase my sales figures in the process. I tried to care. I failed. Eventually I was fired. No hard feelings.\\r\\nThis black street musician is right. Today doesn''t have to be an end for me. It can be a new beginning. Maybe I''ll start my own business, open up a music store. And I could take up playing the saxophone again, not to earn a living, but to make the process of living a little sweeter. What nobler cause to undertake a venture can there be? But before doing any of this I''ll go on a world cruise with Ellen, check out all the places we once talked about longing to see before getting caught up with keeping up with the Jones'', whoever they happen to be. What''s stopping us? We have enough money saved to tide us over for a good while. Our kids are grown now and more or less independent; Rachel having married and then divorced herself into country club money; Herbert lucking into business partnership with a former college classmate and now earning a small fortune not through intelligence, skill or diligence, but solely due to being in the right place at the right time - the American way.\\r\\nMy thoughts are interrupted. The musician is once again playing the song I first heard him performing, the one that lured me to him like a child to the Pied Piper. I allow its sweet melody to caress my senses and find myself humming along. Suddenly I realize why the tune is so familiar to me. I composed it twenty-six years ago. It is the song I wrote for Ellen when I was courting her. This cannot be, and yet it most definitely is. I clear my throat to ask how he could possibly know this particular arrangement of musical notes, but then decide against it. Some things are best left unknown. I continue to listen until the saxophone man finishes my song, after which he grins so brightly that I nearly need to shield my eyes.\\r\\n\"Beautiful, isn''t it?\" he says. \"Now it''s time for you to go home and play it for yourself.\"\\r\\n\"I think you''re right.\"\\r\\nI remove a twenty from my wallet and place it in his instrument''s case. Then I head across the street towards the nearest subway entrance. I can''t wait to get home and discuss with Ellen my wonderful plans for the adventurous future I''ve envisioned for us. She''ll no doubt resist at first, wanting me to be practical, to get back onto the safe road. But I''ve played it cautious long enough. I''m confident that if I stick to these relocated convictions and probe deeply enough into my wife''s heart, I will eventually find the free spirit lurking beneath, long dormant but not yet expired.\\r\\nThe chain of mellifluous chords snakes between the oxygen and nitrogen that comprise the surrounding air. With each step I take the music grows louder and sharper, the acoustics of this street corner defying conventional wisdom. The saxophone man is accompanied by a most unique set of band mates generating sounds only to be found on a New York City street, the ultimate jazz improvisation. Then an unpleasant chord is struck, a high pitched screech that spoils the toe tapping groove. I turn my head just in time to see the alarmed face of a truck driver slamming his foot on a break pedal. But the vehicle has gained too much momentum, and the distance between us is too small. The tires stop spinning, but the grill of the truck moves towards me at a catastrophic rate of speed. An instant later, all fades to back.\\r\\nWhen I awaken, it is in a state of profound confusion. I do not know how long I have been asleep. Perhaps I''ve been in a coma. I am relieved to find that my limbs are fully operational. A quick pat down of my torso fails to reveal anything missing, or even hurting. My health appears to be fine. I must have recovered from whatever injuries I suffered while lying unconscious in this hospital room.\\r\\n\"Looks like you were having quite the dream.\"\\r\\nI turn towards the voice that has startled while informing me that I am not alone. Seated to my right is Dr. Seagram. I wonder why my former psychiatrist has come to pay me a visit. It isn''t as if we became good friends while I was under his care. In fact, during my sessions I made little effort to mask my disdain of him. My wife and kids should be here by my side, not this Freud obsessed fool.\\r\\nAn image from hospital bed scenes in various movies springs to mind. Fearing to discover that while my body is fine, my face is encased like a mummy, I run my fingers from ear to ear and hairline to chin. No bandages or scars are to be found. It seems that I am completely uninjured. Perhaps the truck merely tapped me and I was knocked out when my head hit the ground. Or maybe I passed out in fright, a reasonable reaction to the circumstances. It has become clear that I was certainly not plowed into.\\r\\n\"How did I get here?\"\\r\\nDr. Seagram smiles in that way of his that I have frequently longed to smack from his face, for it toes the line beyond which is a smirk, without quite crossing it.\\r\\n\"You blacked out in your office after. After you were fired, Howard. Do you remember being fired?\"\\r\\n\"Of course I do.\" Oh, how I loathe Dr. Seagram''s condescending tone of voice. My guess is that rather than coaxing patients back to mental health by lending an ear and dispelling sound advice, his technique is to drive them off his couch and back into the chaotic world that loosened their marbles through the overpowering force of his obnoxiousness. \"And I remember leaving the office, having a great conversation with this black guy playing the saxophone on a street corner, and then I think I was hit by a truck while crossing the street.\"\\r\\nDr. Seagram pulls on his beard, one of his many very annoying habits. I can almost literally see the wheels spinning in his head as he tries to psychoanalyze me.\\r\\n\"What you''re describing is what you must have just dreamt, Howard. The truth is, you collapsed in the office of your employer after you were let go. An ambulance brought you here. Therefore you could not have had a conversation with a musician, black, white, purple, or green. And there was no truck accident.\"\\r\\nThe words spoken by Dr. Seagam shake me. As much as I dislike him, I also know him to be a straight shooter. Playing con games is not his style. So I''ve little choice but to accept that his version of events is the true one.\\r\\n\"But it seemed so real. He seemed so real. He inspired me to make major changes in my life. I was looking forward to taking his advice. No offense, Dr. Seagram, but ten minutes spent talking to him was far more motivating and clarifying than all of my sessions with you combined.\"\\r\\n\"No offense taken, Howard. After all, it''s pretty hard to compete against a figment of one''s imagination. Under the circumstances, I think you should give serious consideration to resuming our sessions. I recommend two per week to start. Going back on medication is probably a good idea as well. You have much work to do when it comes to dealing with stress. It''s no wonder a day like this one pushed you over the edge. Not that it''s anything to be embarrassed about. There''s no easy way to cope with being fired from a job you''ve had for decades and being left by your wife on the same day. You have a tendency to hide out in a fantasy whenever reality gets too difficult for you to handle.\"\\r\\n\"Left by my wife? What are you talking about, Dr. Seagram?\"\\r\\n\"Oh my. Apparently you''ve blocked some of what happened this morning from your memory and replaced it with what you just dreamt about. I hate to be the bearer of such bad news, but Ellen moved out of your home. She''s taken up with another man. I''m rather embarrassed to admit that the man she left you for is my colleague, Dr. Robertson.\"\\r\\nTalk about information overload. If only this conversation was my nightmare instead of the awful state of affairs I''ve awakened to. I close my eyes in order to picture the psychiatrist that Dr. Seagram shares a practice with. Our paths only crossed a handful of times. He''s African American, about half an inch taller than me, mid fifties, a salt and pepper afro with a complexion like hot chocolate and prominently white teeth. My eyes open wide, as does my mouth to utter three syllables.\\r\\n\"Oh my God.\" Remembrance is crashing down upon me. The real events of today are assaulting my awareness with perfect clarity, in technicolor. Ellen curtly informed me that she was leaving for good. Unlike prior occasions, it was not merely a bluff for attention. She actually walked out the door this time, out of our marriage, without taking the briefest glance of regret back. Pathetically, I could think of nothing better to do in response than go to work, where as bad luck would have it, I was fired. I did not leave the office on my own terms, or even on my own feet. There was no encounter afterwards with a wise black man who plays the saxophone like an angel. But I didn''t dream the guy up entirely, for he does exist, he is in fact the very same man that Ellen left me for - Dr. Robertson.\\r\\nI close my eyes again, this time in sweet surrender. My senses shut out all stimuli, so if Dr. Seagram is offering words of wisdom or apologizing for his colleague''s behavior or trying to fit future sessions with me into his calendar, I am blissfully unaware. My state of concentration pays off and I am able to bring back what I long for. The music of the saxophone man is washing over me. It will get me through this. The uncaring world that I desperately need protection from has disappeared. Only this glorious music is left behind like a Cheshire smile.\\r\\n<em>Roy Pickering is a freelance writer living in Maplewood, New Jersey.

(31, 1, '2020-04-13 12:05:11', '2020-04-13 20:05:11', 'It is the vegetation-engorged green of June, just an hours before the cicadas start up their grating cries. The sun tilts across a girl''s shoulders, making her shadow and the shadows of shrubs around her grow long and wide. She imagines that she has grown taller, into a monstrous shape. The squishiness of the mud beneath her, the heady fragrance of decay in the air, the steady and pleasant hum of the insects -- all these things she will remember and miss when she is a woman, but for now she just feels and soaks it into memory.\\r\\nShe girl is too skinny, scab-legged and wearing cut-off jean shorts with a Goofy Dog tank top. On her bullet proof feet she has muddy red tennis shoes with one big toe peaking out. Her thick dark hair curls wildly in the damp air as her skin, shiny with sweat under a sky that is eternally blue and sunny, turns darker and darker as fast as bread in a toaster.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThe girl is standing very still because she is afraid that were she to move so much as a muscle, the vegetation beneath her would creak and give her away. She sees a boy hiding too not ten feet away from her. They eye each other so she makes as if she was zipping up her mouth with her fingers and then tossing the key away with a slight flick of the wrist. Theirs is a temporary alliance forged from the intimacy of hide and seek warfare, southern white trash style.\\r\\nShe is carefully planning her escape strategy rather than attack plan, revealing, at eight years old, a deeply practical side. How does she make it across baseball field and to the wall of honeysuckles where her bike is hidden? Once on her bike she knows there is no boy in her neighborhood that can catch her. She is the Queen of Southside Neighborhood on the bike, undefeated reigning speed champion. Yes, the trick is the field of grass ahead of her where she could be caught or pelleted with prickly Sweet Gum seed balls; it is in that space where she has to use her fortitude, her burgeoning superhero powers, to prove that despite who she is she can beat them.\\r\\nShe knew she had a bigger task once she reached safety -- having her mama know she was out playing war with the boys again. They were pleasant enough boys, a little wild, as boys were expected to be. But her mother thought she was too unbridled to mix with them. \"Mi hita\", her mama would say \"Boys only want one thing -- why can''t you stay inside? Like your sister?\" The girl didn''t know what that one thing was, but she knew it wasn''t her. The boys only liked girls Shannon or Sarah; those flowerlike girls in her class with straight thin blond hair, blue eyes and small pretty noses and friendly girlish inflections; whereas she felt more like a weed that had sprung up hearty but uninvited in their manicured garden. The Shannons and the Sarahs reminded her of pale porcelain figures, something lovely for your mantel piece rather than for running around in the swamps and muds playing Sudden Death Hide & Seek. She was built for the latter, she knew, because of her stocky gymnast body, like a compact pit bull. Her hair was wild and thick, and her eyes were dark and tauting, with a dangerous-looking intelligence. She is the snuff colored kicking pony to the Shannon''s of the world ethereal tall white gentle mares.\\r\\nBut none of that mattered now as the adrenaline flooded her system. With a rush of fear and determination she takes off running, leaping into the void in front of her. She feels the energizing warmth of the sun on her back, she hears the rebel yell of boys coming out of their hiding places and feels the soft pelts of seed balls thrown at her from too far a distance. She runs sufficiently frantically all the way to the opposite edge of the field into green upon green upon green. When she grabs her bike she feels this crazy rush of pride and power, her little heart beating as she jumps on her bike. Pumping her legs like pistons the sidewalks beneath the pedals turn a blurry gray and give off shiny sparkles, as if broken glassy rhinestones have been ground with the cement.\\r\\nShe bikes furiously past all the old houses, solidly working-class, in the neighborhood with lawns spray-painted with herbicidal chemicals in the summer. She only catches glimpses of the big, dull-eyed men, with sloped shoulders and sagging bellies hanging over their muscle cars, tinkering with the unknown things under the hoods.\\r\\nOnce home she jumps off the bike without braking. She prances and dances in place. She pretends she is an Olympic medal winner breathlessly thanking her parents, her fans, and that special coach that believed in her when no one else would. The crowd around her(actually a squirrel in an overhead tree scolding her, barking Sammy her faithful dog and a couple of stray cats) cheer riotously as they pump their fists and wave their USA flags. USA! USA! She won the Gold!! These are those tiny fun make believe moments that she make her not want to trade her life for any other, longer or the better life of the Shannons.\\r\\nHer mom is standing at the doorway. Mama is a tiny but fiery woman with straight indian black hair and Cleopatra eyes. She looks just out of place within these squadrons of small-town Christian moms as her daughter, but mama tries hard to fit in. Yet instead of being judged by the symmetry of her vacuum cleaner tract marks, the quality of her drapes, and all those things she could control, mama is be judged by how many generations her family has lived in this town and the Church they don''t go to (First Baptist being the pinnacle of a goodness and guarantee into Heaven). They''ve only been in the country nine years, and daddy is an atheist. \"Aye chata fea!\" Mama exclaims (nicknames, especially insulting ones, are a way of showing affection without showing affection in her family) when she see''s her girl''s muddy appearance. Mama sends her to her room to think about the errors she committed hoping to bore her daughter into submission.\\r\\nThe girl passes her sister sitting primly on the couch reading the encyclopedia, the exact same spot she''s been all day. Her sister''s curly hair is tied tightly into a neat thick braid. An older sister is suppose to be the parent you could never have, the hip, cool mom, but instead she got a goody two shoes for a older sister. They stick their tongues out at each other. The girl makes sure she toots right when she passes her Majesty Of Good.\\r\\nThe girl''s room is full of her child''s breath, flannel, pillows and dreams. She curls up on the bed and resists an atavistic urge to suck her thumb. Sammy sticks his cold nose under her palm. She yearns to burn something down, blow something up, she often feels this way. Then entropy takes over, and she is suddenly too tired even to get undressed. She sleeps until the next day, and goes on to play outside each day, until she is old enough to leave.\\r\\n<em>Memphis Saltos was born and raised in rural southeastern Louisiana by unconventional immigrant parents.

They name him Tony; Anthony on his birth certificate. He learns to talk at six months; learns to walk three months later. His first word is car. Dad owns a Ford. He drives sober; he drives drunk. It makes no difference to him. Not then.\\r\\nThey move to the suburbs when his dad gets a job; move back to the city when he loses it two months later. Pre-school comes along and so does his sister.\\r\\nHelen, they call her. She is cute. Fifth birthday party. Clowns and balloons. Sixth birthday party. More of the same. Long, hot summers; three of them. Friends, lemonade, and laughter. His first kiss, which is yukky, followed by the first white Christmas in twenty years. Auld Lang Syne. Dad hits another bottle, then hits the pavement. The police keep him in a cell for three days.\\r\\nMum is pregnant again, but she has an abortion. Ten years old; double figures. He gets beaten up behind the school huts. Bust lip; black eye. Has a crush on the nurse. Puberty. School with the big kids. He tells his dad to fuck off, kisses with his tongue, and thinks about sex. A lot.\\r\\nMum has an affair and dad gets a promotion. Dad takes his friend Jack Daniels for a drive but doesn''t see the Stop sign, the red light, or the oncoming car. No seatbelt; no chance. Kills himself and takes three others with him. Small funeral; few friends; fewer tears. Mum cries, but only just.\\r\\nHer lover moves in two months later. He''s a jerk but mum loves him. He touches Helen, so Tony knocks him out. Mum shouts and screams then marries the jerk. Tony loses his virginity at sixteen. Messy, awkward, no condom, but you can''t make a baby the first time. School exams. Not enough study but he passes. He wants to be a lawyer. Helen is bullied at school so he fights.\\r\\nHe is tougher now so he gives better than he gets. Step-dad cheats once, twice, maybe more. Mum gets wise and tells him to leave.\\r\\nMore exams. Still not enough study. Fails a couple. First real girlfriend at seventeen. Emma. Mum says she''s a bad influence. Helen agrees. Emma smokes dope and likes to experiment. Tony refuses to join in, but only at first. A few joints, then a couple of tablets, then a line or two. He doesn''t really like it but after a while it doesn''t seem to matter. Emma takes heroin but Tony draws the line there. They split after seven months. Mum says good riddance.\\r\\nHe gets into studying and passes both his re-sits. He is accepted into university a week before he turns eighteen. A man now but he still doesn''t drink because his dad was an asshole when he did. He has sex a few more times with a few more women. One night stands. University starts. A new beginning. New friends. He spends many nights studying and being good, but many more being bad. The police question him about a stolen car, but he is innocent, then about a burglary. He lies and says he knows nothing. The wrong crowd. It happens.\\r\\nHe takes driving lessons, passes, and buys a small car on interest free terms. He meets a girl in the library, gets to know her, gets her pregnant.\\r\\nHer name is Denise and because he believes in doing it properly, her last name is soon the same as his. He leaves university and two months later his daughter is born. She is perfect. Ten fingers and ten toes.\\r\\nHe gets a factory job. It''s not great but it pays the bills. He argues with Denise. They fight about money, about freedom, about most things. His daughter is sick, and suddenly his daughter is dead. Just like that. Cot death they call it. The tragedy brings them closer. Denise tries to take her own life but Tony walks into the bathroom before she puts the blade to her wrist. The doctor says she is depressed and gives her some pills.\\r\\nTony wants another child but it''s too soon. He bumps into a friend he hasn''t seen for ten years. Still the same, only older. They catch up then go their separate ways. People move on. It''s the way it goes. He celebrates one, two, three years of marriage. His mum has a heart attack but she is soon back on her feet. Close call, nonetheless. Helen gets married but gets a divorce soon after. Easy come, easy go.\\r\\nTony and Denise move into the country to get away from the memories, but the one thing you can''t run away from is yourself. Life gets better, as it sometimes does. His wife is smiling again, his mum is strong again, and his sister is engaged again. It''s for real this time, she assures him.\\r\\nTony finds a job with more money and less hours, and soon he and Denise are thinking about starting a family. Again. Denise is scared at first but cries with happiness when the test is positive.\\r\\nHe comes home from work at the same time every day, but today he leaves early because his wife is in labour. He drives to the hospital a little faster than he should. A little too fast. The road is wet but he takes his chances anyway. He tries to brake, tries to turn, but hits the tree square.\\r\\nNo seatbelt, just like dad. No chance either. What goes around, comes around.\\r\\nSplashed on the bonnet. Blood everywhere. His whole life flashing before him. Twenty five years in a heartbeat. Lub-dup. All the ups, downs, and in-betweens. Triumph and tragedy, side by side. Tony thinks about Denise, and hopes this time it''s a boy.\\r\\nHe knows that when he closes his eyes it will be for the last time.\\r\\nSo he does.\\r\\nAnd it is.

Shook her head, leant back, giggled.\\r\\nHe''d always wanted to give her more - would have given her his last… his last anything, she supposed. Just to make her happy. If she was pushed, if she was honest with herself, that was one of the reasons why she''d done it. He was just too goddamn eager to give of himself, until after the years he''d given so much there was nothing left. In the end he''d been so devoted to her that there wasn''t much John there anymore.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nShe glanced at the menu again. Lasagna. Too heavy. Pizza. Oh god no. Ravioli….\\r\\nShe was distracted by a couple of old dears sat at a table a few rows in front of her. They were lifting their menus to read, then placing them down as they found a new piece of gossip to spread, like a pair of Parisian courtiers flicking their fans about in courtship. She wondered if they''d ever get chance to eat.\\r\\nThe one furthest from her gently touched the other, placing her hand on her friend''s Angora scarf and rubbing it gently between her thumb and forefinger. She could almost hear the cooing of a stoked ego, and she instinctively touched the ring he''d given her, rubbing its stone with her thumb and spinning it round her finger. It was only a cheap rhinestone set in blue plastic, bought more as a joke than anything, but she just couldn''t let it go. She felt her hand naked without it.\\r\\n…Ravioli…yeah, ravioli…\\r\\nBut she was a better person now. Now she''d done it. Taken charge. She was still young. She''d saved and saved then gone out to the lots on her own and haggled the fat old men down, even though they''d done nothing but stare at her chest when she was asking about the mileage. And she''d closed them. Made them cut the price. All right, it wasn''t a Cadillac, but it was hers. Something she''d done.\\r\\nAnd yeah, she liked living alone. She could watch whatever she liked on TV, drink a bottle of wine if she wanted, which, if she thought about it, was getting to be most nights these days…\\r\\n…God, ravioli was boring. Salad would be better. Something fresh. Yeah, chicken salad, with the dressing on the side…\\r\\n…And all right, there were some bad days. Like that morning when she just couldn''t get out of bed, even to make a cup of tea. But she worked hard, was entitled to take it easy once in a while. Shit, what''s a few extra hours in bed? And there was no one to moan that she wasn''t up and about.\\r\\nIt was getting noisy; the conversation level raising as more people came in for lunch. She reached for her water to take another sip. A little hit her lips, then the ice jiggled and fell out of any order it had been lodged in, splashing cold water on her face and down her chin.\\r\\nSome independent woman…can''t even fucking drink properly.

The Perry Mason rerun was almost over, and Jerome was sure he had the killer nailed.\\r\\nThe phone rang but Jerome didn''t answer. He let the machine take the message. \"Jerome, this is Amelia. I''m pregnant.\"\\r\\nJerome looked over at his mother. She didn''t say anything. Her old faded housecoat was pulled around her like a shroud.\\r\\n\"Who do you think the killer is, Ma?\" Jerome asked. Perry was wrapping it up. Jerome slid to the edge of his chair, feeling all excited inside. Perry revealed the killer. \"Right, right!\" Jerome squealed, pointing at the screen. \"I knew it.

Then he damp mopped the lobby, the elevator floor, and the laundry room. Someone had left a half bottle of Tide on one of the washers and Jerome put it on his pushcart. He liked his job in the condo; he often found things that he took home to his mother.\\r\\nWhen he went home for lunch he gave her the Tide. \"Here, Ma,\" he said, setting it next to her on the sofa where he found a little space between the dead house plant Mrs. McMurty had given him two months ago, and the broken vase from the card room. The sofa was filled with assorted gifts. \"I guess I''ll have to put some of your stuff on the floor soon,\" Jerome said.

(37, 1, '2020-04-17 14:01:28', '2020-04-17 22:01:28', 'North Street was lined with boutiques, rare book dealers, and antique shops. Laura walked along slowly, looking in each window, savoring the moment. It was like a street of dreams, filled with oddities and beautiful things from the past. The clock on the bank building across the street said 9 AM.\\r\\nWhen she saw the little brass bowl in the curio shop window, Laura knew immediately that she wanted it. Since James left her last month, she hadn''t treated herself to anything, and the shiny brass bowl would liven up the apartment. A small white card placed next to the bowl read: Circa l400.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nLaura hoped it wouldn''t be too expensive. She still had a little bit of her inheritance from her grandmother''s estate that she came into last year when she turned twenty-one. Laura stared at the bowl, fascinated by the strange handle. Was that handle there when she first looked? It must have been. Probably just a trick of the morning sunlight. She saw herself reflected in the window, insulated from the traffic noise on the street. The world vanished in silence, and Laura''s mind drifted. She tumbled back in time and saw the brass bowl as it had once belonged to the Pharaoh.\\r\\nLaura blinked. The little brass bowl had an etching of a Pharaoh''s face on the handle. She didn''t know why, but she had to have that bowl. It called to her.\\r\\nOn the door of the curio shop a sign was posted: WELCOME. COME IN. When Laura entered, a beautiful East Indian woman in a green sari padded over. Her jet black hair was braided and wound tightly around her head. \"Yes, Miss, we have it,\" she said.\\r\\nLaura frowned. \"Have what?\"\\r\\n\"Whatever you want.\" The woman smiled. \"Beauty. Love. Money. Death.\"\\r\\n\"What did you say?\" Laura asked. The woman''s English wasn''t very good. Surely she meant something else.\\r\\n\"Yes, Miss. We have plenty of jewelry. Jade, emerald, stones of blood.\" She bent forward in a little bow, and thin black snakes were coiled tightly around the top of her head.\\r\\nLaura stepped back with a small cry. The woman raised her head again, and Laura saw no more snakes, only braids. What was wrong with her? She kept seeing things that weren''t there. James always told her she didn''t keep her mind on the moment, but kept dreaming of other things that she wanted, but that they couldn''t afford. Perhaps he had been right. She said, \"I don''t want any jewelry. I''d like to see that little brass bowl in your window.\"\\r\\nThe saleswoman shook her head. \"Have no glass bowl. I''ll get the jewelry.\" She turned quickly and went through a doorway.\\r\\n\"Not glass, brass,\" Laura called, and heard her voice muffled by the dusty sunbeams of the window display. From this side she couldn''t see the bowl. It was probably behind one of the other items, the statue of Buddha or the wicker trunk. She peered through the clutter. No bowl. She''d have to go back outside to see its exact location.\\r\\nLaura opened the door and stepped through. There was no outside. She was in a basement, filled with antiques and bric-a-brac, all jumbled together. A dangling light bulb cast yellowish shadows across the huddled items.\\r\\nWhat a foolish mistake, to have chosen the wrong doorway. But how did she get into a basement? These old buildings had strange passageways. When she turned to go back, the doorway was gone. A tremor of alarm washed over her, for she was surrounded by teddy bears, weather vanes, quilts, rag dolls, toy trains, and a carousel horse.\\r\\nThis was impossible. She had come in through a doorway; there had to be a doorway out. Everything was in her way, blocking her view. She placed her foot in the stirrup and mounted the carousel horse.\\r\\nThe basement looked exactly like her grandmother''s attic, when Laura was a child of five. It had always frightened her, because everything was so big and threatening. Dark shapes slid across her memory: a stuffed owl that stared at her with evil amber eyes; a jack-in-the-box that erupted with screeches of menacing laughter; a baby doll that cried \"Mama! Mama!\" over and over, while one eye hung loose in its socket.\\r\\nNo, wait - - Laura squeezed her eyes shut and remembered now. She had beaten up the baby doll so that her grandmother would give her a new one. Laura kept pestering her grandmother, whose face that day was muddy gray. \"Get me a different doll,\" Laura had demanded, pointing to the attic.\\r\\n\"I can''t go up,\" her grandmother said, leaning weakly against the table. A little bass bowl slid to the floor. \"I don''t feel well. You''ll have to go up and get one.\"\\r\\nLaura cried and made a fuss and saw her grandmother trying to reach the phone With the pit of her stomach held tightly in, Laura went up into the mysterious attic. She burrowed into the tangle of toy drums and dead puppets The owl watched her, his head turning to see where she went. The jack-in-the-box shrieked with laughter. A hurdy-gurdy wheezed tinny music.\\r\\nLaura grabbed a doll from the trunk and hurried back down the stairs. Her grandmother was lying on the floor. A Pharaoh''s eyes glinted at Laura from the little brass bowl.\\r\\nShe watched as he whirled about like a demon. Shaking with fear, Laura kicked at the bowl and the demon swirled back into the shiny metal.\\r\\nThreads of blood trickled from her grandmother''s mouth. While Laura played with her doll, her grandmother lay on the floor, not speaking or moving. Laura knew it was some kind of punishment the demon did to her grandmother for not going up into the attic to get the doll. Laura didn''t care, because she got punished too, sometimes. After a while, somebody came, picked up Laura, and took her away. She never saw her grandmother again.\\r\\nThe basement grew cold now, and Laura shivered. She had always been haunted by the memory of that selfish little girl.\\r\\nShe opened her eyes. The smell of mold hung heavily over her and spider webs trembled from the shadowy ceiling. Broken toys were scattered about. A jack-in-the-box lay on its side, the spring crushed. An old rag doll leaned in a corner, its wooly hair faded and dusty. The paint on the carousel horse was brittle with age and flakes crumbled off as Laura climbed down.\\r\\nShe saw a doorway on her left, and went through. She was back on North Street, looking into the window of the curio shop, with someone standing beside her. The little brass bowl gleamed in the morning sunshine. The woman in the green sari said, \"Yes, Miss. Old Egyptian brass bowl. It has strange powers, to show us who we are.\"\\r\\n\"And who we once were,\" Laura said, as the woman faded.\\r\\nThe clock on the bank building said 9 AM.\r\n', 'The Little Brass Bowl by Vera Searles', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'the-little-brass-bowl-by-vera-searles', '', '', '2020-04-17 14:01:28', '2020-04-17 22:01:28', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=37', 0, 'post', '', 1),

Don''s right fist banged down on the cheap wood and the whole door vibrated like a broken drum, the sound echoing, booming over the cracked cement path that ran through the foot-high lawn, across the road with the discarded cars on bricks and over to the lock-ups at the foot of the tower blocks, where it bounced back at a higher pitch, like the crack of a gun shot.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\"C''mon Neville!

It''s already half ten an'' I''ve not even had a brew yet…Jesus…\"\\r\\nHe went back to studying the paper. Don turned and banged again. This time, when the boom had died, he heard movement behind the door. He readied himself, his weight on his left arm against the wood, ready to push. But whoever was inside was pushing too. Must be trying it on, he thought, so he leant in further. Sweat beaded on his forehead with the effort, as the person inside began to throw his shoulder against the door, bouncing against Don''s weight.\\r\\n\"Trust me, this''ll just make it worse.

She throws an arm over the side of the bed, feeling around in the darkness for the plastic wastebasket she put there before she lay down. Her hand gropes at the air, occasionally bouncing off the side of the mattress, searching for the wastebasket. She finds it lying on the floor, the contents-tissue, crumpled paper, snack wrappers and soda cans-are scattered over the carpet around the bed. One of the cats must have upset it while she was sleeping.\\r\\nBy the time she brings it up to her mouth the pain has passed and she is fully awake. She hears the running water of the canal outside the open window, the occasional rattle of an old muffler in the distance. She looks toward the doorway and sees the dim light of the lamp coming from the other room. She knows he''s not there.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nShe drags her legs over the side of the bed and now that she''s sitting up she can feel how tired and sore and stiff her body is, partly from being woken up in the middle of the night, but also because she''s not treating herself the way that she should. He used to ask her to take better care of herself, and she thinks she would if he ever asked her to now, but she can''t seem to find the energy anymore, let alone a reason for why she should.\\r\\nHer ankles make cracking noises as she stands up, first leaning against the teakwood dresser for support, then standing fully erect, her back arched, arms out. She takes the pack of cigarettes off the dresser on her way to the bathroom. She hasn''t had one in almost two weeks and she''s dying for a smoke. When she sits down on the toilet a wave of nausea passes over her and she doubles over, hugging herself, her legs crossed, locked at the knees. She holds the pack of cigarettes in one hand, pressing them against her chest, while the other hand rubs circles counterclockwise over her belly. She wishes he were there to brush the hair out of her face, to massage her body and sit with her.\\r\\nBy the time she''s finished urinating the pain has subsided and she pulls her sweat shorts back up, ignoring the loose drawstring. She opens the medicine cabinet and pushes aside the unopened cartridge of birth control pills to get to the aspirin. The cap isn''t on the bottle right and she''s forced to use more strength than she thinks she has to get it open. She swallows two of the small white tablets without water and leaves the bottle on the counter. The pills turn into powder on their way down and she winces at the bitterness, but is too tired to do anything about it.\\r\\nThe halogen lamp lights only a corner of the living room, but she''s able to find his watch, which is on the breakfast bar next to the basket of loose change. The metal band and glass face feel cool on her skin as she presses it against her cheek, wishing he had it with him so that he knew how late it is. He probably knows anyway, but doesn''t care, she thinks. She tilts the watch toward the light to read the numbers; it says a quarter to three. She wonders if he will be coming home at all tonight.\\r\\nAs she turns off the porch light and unlocks the deadbolt, an assembly of cats crowd around her, rubbing up against her legs, waiting to be let out. When she opens the door, two or three quickly squeeze through while a few more shove their way in, as if she might change her mind and shut the door at any moment. The cats are all strays, ones that she found prowling around the apartment complex. She likes looking after them. She feeds them and allows them to stay with her, and most of them have made the apartment their home while others come only for the wet food she leaves outside the door in the mornings.\\r\\nShe steps outside, closing the door behind her, careful not to shut it on any of the cats'' tails. As she sits down at the top of the stairs, she suddenly wishes that her neighbor''s porch light wasn''t on. It attracts more insects than she''s willing to share the early morning with and she isn''t able to see the stars the way she should. All she can see in the pre-dawn twilight is the nearly rusted through railing she is leaning up against, and beyond that the worn down crab grass where the children dig for earthworms to dissect in the summer evenings, and beyond that the weeds growing in the gutter of the aluminum covered carports, and beyond that the canal that she likes to pretend is really a river, winding its way west to someplace beautiful, someplace other than here.\\r\\nShe remembers the drowning that happened in the canal only a few months ago, when it was still plenty full and the rush of muddy water almost did sound like a river below her window. A boy who had lived in one of the apartments with his grandmother had been down by the canal fishing with his friends. Something caught on his line, which was nothing more than a piece of knotted twine tied to the end of a rusty handlebar, he lost his footing in the loose dirt and fell into the water, skinning his shins on the concrete lip of the canal on his way in. She never saw his body when they pulled him out of the water, but dreamt she had seen it, shriveled and blue, curled up into itself, floating on the surface of the brown water, the current moving steadily beneath his unmoving body. Then she had woken up to find Paulo lying next to her, breathing softly, sleeping, and for the first time she heard the whispering of the water, rolling over and over, along with the evening breeze.\\r\\nShe thinks about that boy now and wonders if he ever would have gotten away from the canal, if his grandmother would ever have had enough money to raise him someplace that wasn''t like this, someplace that had clear water and clear skies, that looked down on the valley instead of down at the ditches and dirt and cracked asphalt and weeds. She wonders if anyone ever leaves a place like this, then remembers the offer Paulo got from his cousin in Lompoc. She is sure he will leave. It isn''t even a question anymore.\\r\\nThe clamminess of her hand has moistened the pack of cigarettes and now the box is warped. She sets it down beside her and stands up-not all the way, just high enough to unscrew the bulb of her neighbor''s porch light-then she crouches back down, feeling the soreness in her thighs and buttocks, the sweat gathering around her neck, on her back, behind her knees. She takes a cigarette out of the pack and places it between her lips, but doesn''t light it. She knows she shouldn''t, but she''s not sure she won''t.\\r\\nAlthough the air is warm and thick with humidity, she shivers a little at the choice she has to make. She scratches an itch on her arm and feels a small bump on her elbow. The mosquitoes will eat her alive if she stays out here, but she isn''t ready yet to go back inside. She has a decision to make that can no longer wait. She has never done the responsible thing before and it frightens her a bit, makes her skin goosepimply and taut. She clenches her lips on the cigarette still dangling from her mouth. She wishes Paulo would pull up under the carport, at least that might help sway her one way or another, but he doesn''t come and she knows that he probably won''t.\\r\\nIt was only two weeks ago when she came home from a late shift at the taco shack and told him the news. He hadn''t touched her, not a slap or a kiss. He knew she had done it intentionally, that she would do anything to keep him there with her. Although his dark chiseled features revealed nothing, she thought he seemed relieved. He simply nodded before he turned away and said, \"Okay.\" It had reminded her of the time that she had suggested they move in together, that he take refuge from his drunken stepfather at her apartment. She told him that he could leave anytime he wanted, that it was just a place to stay. He had never lived with anyone before-he had barely just dropped out of high school-and it had been comforting to have him around in the evenings when she needed someone to share things with. Her favorite thing to do was share secrets with him in the dark, when they were lying in bed together listening to the sounds of the canal. She never really had any secrets before-her life was exactly the way it looked-but she made some up just to have something to tell him, something to make him feel closer to her.\\r\\nBut all that was ruined now, flushed away like the cloudy sentiment of the canal water, all because she had quit taking the pill. If only he knew why she had done it, he wouldn''t let her wait outside like this in the dark with the mosquitoes, regretting what she had done, wondering what she should do about it now that she knew he would leave her.\\r\\nShe lights the cigarette that is between her lips, but she does not inhale. She watches, entranced, as the tendrils of blue smoke weave around one another, spiraling upward. Resting her chin on her knees, she stares at the orange glow of the cigarette, the ash flaking off and dirtying her bare feet, until it finally burns itself out. She could light it again, take a deep drag and try to forget all about it, hope for a miscarriage or go to the clinic, but instead she places it under the heel of her foot and smears the remaining ash across the top step. She will try to be more responsible now. Paulo will leave, but she will definitely be more responsible.\\r\\nHolding the box of remaining cigarettes, she gets up and carefully makes her way down the stairs. She walks across the coarse grass, still wet from the sprinklers that come on in the evenings. She walks under the carport, stepping over the yellow weeds that are growing in the cracks of the asphalt, and over to the canal where, to her surprise, she can''t smell the mustiness of the algae and brown water she knows is idling below; she can only smell the dust clouding around her feet, sticking to her damp skin.

Yet I do not shoo the fly away. My lifeless body is numb and unresponsive in spite of my active mind that buzzes with replays of the horror of this day, of flashbacks to the days that preceded it, and of visions of the days that would go on without me.\\r\\nIs this an eternal torture I am fated to endure, a perverse punishment for my supposed deceit; a fervent mind in a lifeless vessel? \"This is not justice,\" I scream in my head. \"I never planned to trick anyone.\" All I wanted was freedom to follow the urge that beckoned from my heart. No more than any person ever wants, or deserves. Hurting Ron was no callous, calculated act; it just happened.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nSoon, Jolene and Sean will return, and I am horrified that they will find me this way. A dead husband, a dead father, a stiff, contorted body riddled with gaping knife wounds at the bottom of the staircase. There could not be a more shocking discovery, right? Wrong, my friend, so wrong. I should have trusted in Jolene and my love. I should have trusted in Jolene. She would have understood had I only allowed her the chance, but now it is too late. Any chance to explain has passed, the opportunity to right my wrongs forever gone. Never will I be able to look Jolene in the eye and ease the hurt, the confusion, the anger of the woman I have always adored.\\r\\nAnd what will Sean think, my precious little boy, when he sees his Daddy dressed in a pearl-white silk blouse and black knit skirt, opaque tights and shiny knee-high black boots? What will my little boy think of his father''s bright red lips, of his mascara-coated lashes, of his blonde wig? What will Sean think of me then? Will he ever again remember throwing the baseball around together, our annual father-son camping trip, the wrestling matches on the living room floor? Will he ever recall anything about his father beyond the glossy red lips and stocking-covered legs?\\r\\nIt started quite innocently. The feelings, the urges, the needs, they had been bubbling below the surface for some time and then all of a sudden they broke through and I had to act on them. The missing part of my life; it had to be fulfilled. So when Jolene left for her regular girls-night-out Fridays, and when Sean had gone to bed, Lisa Baker would come to baby sit and I would become Hannah Ross. The first few times, fear kept me anchored in the bedroom, but on the fifth Friday, I found myself at the Diamond Bar and Grill, sipping a mimosa.\\r\\n\"Can I buy you another?\" a heady masculine voice had said, and my heart almost stopped. Surely when I turned to face the voice''s owner, my charade would be over. But it wasn''t. He smiled. \"No strings, just a drink,\" he spoke softly, possibly mistaking my silent panic for coyness.\\r\\nI nodded.\\r\\n\"Great,\" he replied, as he settled on the bar stool to my right. \"I haven''t seen you here before. You new to the area?\"\\r\\nHow many times had I used that line before I met Jolene? Sitting on the receiving end, I realized how corny men''s pick-up lines sounded. Yet I liked this guy; he had a kind face and he was keeping his physical distance, not pushy.\\r\\nI cleared my throat. \"Yes,\" I lied, \"just moved here from Kansas last week.\"\\r\\n\"Great place,\" he commented. \"I used to travel there for work a lot. By the way, my name''s Ron.\"\\r\\n\"Nice to meet you, Ron. I''m Hannah.\" I thought my voice sounded a little gruff, but if it did, Ron hadn''t noticed.\\r\\n\"Hannah, that''s a beautiful name,\" he said.\\r\\nThis game was getting harder, and I had never planned on attracting a man; that wasn''t my motivation for dressing as a woman. It was simply an urge I could no longer suppress.to be out in public as a woman. I could not explain it, but I needed to know how that felt, hungered for the experience, but I did not strive to become a woman. My love for my wife had not lessened, and I never intended to stop being her husband. Only I wanted to be Hannah Ross from time to time, too.\\r\\nAt least that is how it started.\\r\\nI agreed to meet Ron the next Friday night, and then again the next Friday, and the next. We had a good time together. Conversation flowed effortlessly: after all, we did have a lot in common.\\r\\nNot once had I thought of my relationship with Ron as cheating on Jolene. After all, he was a man and nothing sexual had ever passed between us. On occasion, Ron had suggested taking our relationship to the \"next level,\" but I had always successfully diverted the topic. So when I returned from work one Monday to find Jolene sobbing on our bed, I was shocked when she asked me point blank if I was having an affair. \"Good heavens, no,\" I exclaimed. What on earth made her think that?\\r\\nAs it turned out, the ''what'' was a ''who.'' My paid-extra-to-keep-quiet Friday night baby-sitter had slipped up and Jolene had discovered my secret Friday night adventures. Although she knew nothing of the crossdressing; only that I would slip out of the house after she left. For a brief moment I considered being honest, telling her about this other part of my soul that demanded fulfillment, but foolishly, my faith in our marriage was too weak. So instead, I fibbed to Jolene that I had joined a bowling league and we played Friday nights. I claimed I hadn''t told her because I knew how she felt about leaving Sean with a baby-sitter, that she had told me the only reason she went out on her Friday girls'' nights was because she knew I would be home with Sean. It was a pathetic, contrived tale, but Jolene accepted it, or at least claimed that she did; she needed to.\\r\\nThere was anger and tears, and then the decision to start spending Friday nights at home, together. Even had Jolene and I not come to that conclusion, I knew the time had come to put an end to whatever it was Ron and I shared; and I owed him a truthful explanation. Afraid of re-activating Jolene''s suspicions if I ventured out alone again, - or perhaps that logic served to excuse my cowardice - I chose to reveal all to Ron over the phone. Words alone were insufficient to capture the force of Ron''s emotion. How dare I trick him that way, he demanded to know. He had never met anyone more disgusting, more vile, more perverted than me, Ron said. I listened to him gagging, he spat into the phone. I was scum and I would pay for what I did to him. By the time Ron slammed the phone down, I was shaking uncontrollably, sick to my stomach from knowing the pain and anger I had unintentionally caused him, repulsed by my own selfish needs and actions, and terrified by thoughts of how he might seek revenge.\\r\\nBut the weeks passed without incident and Jolene and my life returned to normal, if normal can be defined as the way it was before I fed my desires. And I stopped watching my back whenever I left the house; I pocketed Ron in a folder in my mind labeled: \"regrettable mistakes\" and I moved on.\\r\\nThen one night, Jolene went to a bachelorette party and Sean had a sleep over at a friend''s house. I was alone, totally alone, and I could no longer resist. The box''s seal snapped easily, just as I had known it would, and its contents almost leapt out at me. My beautiful clothes, my make-up, my wig; oh, how much I had missed them. I took my time, savoring every part: the smoothness of the stockings against my legs, the snug fit of my feet and calves in the boots, the silky softness of the blouse against my chest. Slowly and carefully I applied my make-up.a little more rouge, a touch-up of the lipstick, the almost ceremonial placement of the wig. At last, Hannah Ross was back. You look stunning, darling , I whispered to myself.\\r\\nAnd then I heard the back door slam. Darn. Jolene? Sean? No, no, no! But it wasn''t either of them; it was Ron. Six feet four inches of enraged male screamed at me to show myself. Grabbing a hairbrush as my feeble weapon of protection, I headed downstairs to confront my aggressor. Surely I could calm Ron; he had always seemed such a gentle, rationale man. The heel of my right boot caught in the carpet on the second to last step and I tumbled, landing on my back, the hairbrush thrust from my grip by the force of the fall.\\r\\nThen, there he stood towering over me, his face reddened with rage, his breathing slow and heavy. \"I told you I''d make you pay,\" he scowled.\\r\\n\"Ron, please, Ron.\" His vice-like grip around my neck choked my pleas.\\r\\nRon scoffed. \"Look at you now, all decked out. Heading off to your next victim, were you? Huh, huh, were you?\"\\r\\nStill I couldn''t utter a sound, and it felt as though my eyes were bulging from their sockets.\\r\\n\"Well I''m going to save the poor sucker,\" he spat. \"Goodbye, Hannah Ross. Or whoever you really are.\"\\r\\nHelplessly, I watched him raise the butcher''s knife high with his free right hand. He laughed hysterically as the first plunge of shimmering metal pierced my stomach. And then the second, and the third, and the fourth.and by the thirtieth or so jab I felt no more pain. I listened to his footsteps retreat into the kitchen and out the back door. He didn''t even bother to close it on his way out. And I knew I was dead. Dead and degraded in my own home, murdered to avenge a crime I did not truly commit. But then again, it is oft said that crimes of passion are rarely born from sanity.\\r\\nI hear the key turn in its lock in the front door. Jolene and Sean are laughing. \"Honey, we''re home,\" my lovely wife calls out. Although they do not know it as yet, my wife and son have laughed for the last time.', 'Secrets of a Murdered Man by Sabrina Walls', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'secrets-of-a-murdered-man-by-sabrina-walls', '', '', '2020-04-20 14:57:03', '2020-04-20 22:57:03', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=40', 0, 'post', '', 1),

(42, 1, '2020-04-22 15:48:18', '2020-04-22 23:48:18', 'I held my grandfather''s hand, and looked into his eyes, filled as they were with pain and suffering. How many times had the doctors said, \"He''s going to die,\" and yet he''d lived another year, another five? Yet this time, I could not bring myself to believe that they were wrong. He laid his head back down, and closed his eyes to rest. I stared at him, and realized that I had barely known my grandfather.\\r\\nMost of his life had passed him by before I was even born. What there was left of it, he ending up letting go in a puff of cigarette smoke. I rarely saw him without his surrounding cloud; when I was about ten, I criticized him for his poor habit. How painful it was, now, to learn that I was wrongfully pressuring him; he could not stop himself, it was an addiction like any other. And it ate away at him, until all that was left was this frail body before me, laboring for every breath.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI have so few fond memories of him that do not include a smoke cloud. But, when I was much younger, he would try to put out his smokes when we came. Instead, he would sit in his kitchen, in his underwear, and teach his six-year-old granddaughter to swear. This usually brought fire from my father. \"You don''t need to teach her words like that!\" He chastised his father as he shooed me away.\\r\\nGrandpa had laughed at him, \"Damn right I do! I watch the news; this damn world ain''t safe for wimmin no more. She gotta learn ta be tough! I''d teach her ta fight too, but I''m too damn old. What I can''t figure out is why you don''t.\"\\r\\n\"Dad, she''s six. She''s perfectly safe. Adrian, why don''t you run along and play with some of the toys?\" Grandpa always kept toys about, usually the odd, cheap buggers from Avon or another TV channel.\\r\\nOf course, I had other targets in mind. I snuck into their bedroom, where I saw the small tower. It was one of those brown, shelving things that you sit on your dresser and fill with candy. Grandpa was smarter than that though.\\r\\nThere were three layers; one was always empty, one was always filled with fisherman''s cough drops, and the last was filled with--joy of joys--butter mints.\\r\\nI snuck into his room to steal some of the mints; I''d been here last week, and I''d discovered them in the middle shelf, so--of course--that was the one I opened.\\r\\nI heard him laughing behind me as I looked in it and saw--horror of horrors! Fisherman''s cough drops! What bigger let down is there for a six-year-old looking for candy than to come upon nasty cough drops where candy should be?\\r\\nI turned to scowl at him. \"Grandpa! You bastard, you switched them!\" My father blanched at my language, and immediately set out to punish me.\\r\\n\"Don''t you dare, kiddo.\" My father froze halfway to me, and Grandpa laughed again. \"She''s learning to be tough, aren''t you my girl?\" I flexed my puny muscles for him, and growled.\\r\\nHe laughed again, but it was a laugh that turned into a cough, and a cough that didn''t end...my father turned his worried face to his father, who shook his head, and smiled a little at me. He tried to make light of it by saying, \"Better luck next time, Adrian!\" It was too late to check another, so I went back out to their kitchen, and accepted a poor substitute in butterscotch disks. I didn''t always loose, but I rarely won. A few weeks later, Grandpa was taken to the hospital. His heart was beating too slowly, so they wanted to put in a pacemaker. But I was six, and only knew that my beloved Grandfather was ill. My father took me and my younger brother with him when he went to explain the procedure to his mother. My brother had never been on a butter mints raid, so I snuck him into the bedroom with me. I opened the middle shelf, but found cough drops, yet again. Confused, I went for the bottom shelf; Grandma and Dad were too busy talking to notice us in here. This one was empty, so I opened the top. It was empty too.\\r\\nThere were no more butter mints. I think that was the first time I realized that this vile darkness caused by his smoking would always be there. He would never be able to defeat it. It would always mutilate whatever happiness we had together, as its deadly clouds billowed about his head, like a pall. He was as much a prisoner of his smoking as anyone behind bars, and nothing, not the great strength of my Grandfather, let alone my meager strength. He would never be able to escape it, and he would never be able to help himself any more than any other addict.\\r\\nA weak cough brought me back to reality. Smoking had done this to my Grandfather, who had moved the butter mints around, who had taught me how to swear. Thanks to his cigarettes, my grandfather''s life was cut so short.\\r\\nHe caught my somewhat preoccupied look, and squeezed my hand. I realized then that he knew. That was what was hurting us both worse than anything man can contrive. He knew he was going to die soon. \"Rest, Grandpa.\" He laid his head back down and continued watching the football game. New Year''s Eve is a rotten time to hold the hand of someone you love, and wait for them to die. The clock struck midnight, and it was officially 2003.\\r\\nGrandpa began to roll his shoulders as if he were in pain. \"Grandpa? Are you okay? What are you doing?\"\\r\\nHe looked at me, shockingly lucid. \"I''m spreading my angel wings.\"He smiled at me, and I smiled back. For all that I had barely known him, I knew he was going to need his wings.\\r\\nTwo hours later, I noticed his hand growing cold. His eyes were closed, and my Grandfather was gone. Maybe I should have run down the hall and screamed for the nurses, but I knew he wanted to go. If there was a God, He had called my Grandfather, and Grandpa wasn''t coming back.\\r\\nI sat in the front row of his funeral, and held my Grandmother''s hand this time. She sobbed constantly, and could not be consoled. She knew I was there when he went, so she had asked for me to be here for her, in the front. The pastor had to speak loudly to be heard over her sobs. \"We all have fond memories of Robert. Who would like to share theirs?\"\\r\\nI stood, surprised at myself, but full of determination. \"Most everyone here knew him as a strong man. He was just my Grandpa, and one thing will always remind me of him-butter mints.\"\r\n', 'Butter Mints by Adrian Lavan', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'butter-mints-by-adrian-lavan', '', '', '2020-04-22 15:48:18', '2020-04-22 23:48:18', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=42', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(46, 1, '2020-04-25 16:22:31', '2020-04-26 00:22:31', 'Why do I write?\\r\\nI''ve been asked to explain this on more than one occasion, often in a Yuletide forum by relatives who want only what''s best for me. These questions are presented with a roll of the eye or an unassuming furrowed brow and often contain the words ''what'', ''in'', ''the'' and ''hell''. Each time the question is posed, the more difficult I find it to answer. As time passes, the reasoning that once seemed so black and white, morphs more and more into a menagerie of Freudian color and malformations, looking less like the once straight forward presentation and more like the aftermath of a drunken war of paintbrushes between Pollock and Neiman.\\r\\nAs a child, the stories were necessary as an escape to the anything-but-civil war taking place in my house. But now, as an adult, that excuse, much like the ones used to justify biting my sister, no longer exists. So, why keep writing? Because the stories keep coming, whether I want them to or not. Sometimes they''ll wake me from a PG-13 dream (rated so as it contained the occasional profanity) with a far from gentle nudge to my shoulder. \"Hey, wake up! I just thought of a good story. Listen, listen. Okay, there''s this guy,...you following me, so far?\" I may resent these at first, but getting it out on paper, in the end, is as thrilling an accomplishment for me as the mad scientist realizing his dream to create the ultimate death ray to control mankind.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nAnother reason, though, one just as important in my book (even that one''s unpublished) is to entertain. Not just myself, but anyone who will read (which, as it currently stands, are friends and the occasional editor or literary agent wanting me to lose their address in the future). I am not so narcisistic to think I can change the world via my prose. All I want is to make someone smile before they return to their passionless job or turn on the evening news to find out the world still spins in a downward spiral. Too many writers I''ve met set out with the intention of making a profound statement, of being seen as an intellectual commentator wishing to open the eyes of their fellow man. That sort of writing has its place, definitely, but can also be saturated and senseless if too many voices at once scream for the Pulitzer to look their way. My belief is much simpler. As said in the Preston Sturges film Sullivan''s Travel, \"A lot can be said for making people laugh. Do you know that''s all some people have? It isn''t much, but its better than nothing in this cockeyed caravan.\"\\r\\nAnother driving force, unarguably the most selfish of all, is the fear of death. The fear of being forgotten like Alice Gilkey 1887-1935. Who? Exactly. One story published is forever available to future readers or seekers of the obscure and mediocre. To entertain is one thing, to entertain from beyond the confines of time and space is magical. The thought of someone enjoying reading that which I enjoyed writing is a beautiful one.\\r\\nWhy do I write?\\r\\nIf the reason I write was on trial for murder and my argument determined its fate, its last words may very well be, \"Did the governor call?\" I''m not sure whether I could convince anyone that my reasons for writing are just. If I could, I wouldn''t question it myself every night before falling asleep. Maybe the question itself is unanswerable in a way that would convert nay-sayers and left brainers to be in unanimous agreement in respects to my literary pursuits. Perhaps, no one argument is enough, just as a thousand answers may be too few. So, perhaps I have wasted the reader''s time, for which I apologize, but it cannot be said that my efforts were insincere. Again, why do I write? I write because...well, because I''m a writer.\r\n', 'Because I Haven''t Got the Legs for Dancing by Mike Calahan', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'because-i-havent-got-the-legs-for-dancing-by-mike-calahan', '', '', '2020-04-25 16:22:31', '2020-04-26 00:22:31', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/non-fiction/because-i-havent-got-the-legs-for-dancing-by-mike-calahan/', 0, 'post', '', 0),

She would steal her dad’s big, denim overalls from his closet, the pockets large enough to hold all the equipment needed for the dig: the map, a mini-shovel, a small flashlight, and diary to document what you found. You would all give each other really snazzy sounding explorer names, like Bobby Trouble or Darren Danger. She was Kathryn Caper, the crappiest of all the names, yes, and you felt the need to tell her that in front of the gang over and over. Now she lays outside in her front yard wearing an orange bikini. She sits on a big yellow beach towel, looking at preteen magazines about boys and makeup while talking on her parent’s cordless phone.  You watch her as the three of you set up to dig for more treasure, her tiny, tanning hands rubbing lotion into her legs, and you think about how she used to help you dig. Tiny smudges of dirt would smear on her cheeks as she would giggle and throw clumps of soil and grass at you. You try not to cry as the other two boys break ground.\\r\\nShe wasn’t around when it came time to play cowboys and Indians, making it impossible to play that game. You can’t have one of the other boys be the damsel in distress that the Indians kidnap; that would be gross. Instead you have to play cops and robbers. It’s quite unfair, the two other boys being the thieves and you playing the cop, making it almost impossible for you to stop crime. You chase the robbers around the backyard, following far behind because one of them distracted you while the other grabbed the cash. They spilt up, one of them ducking down the side yard and the other springing down the street. It would be so much easier if she had just come back over. She could take the one boy who ran down the side of the house, while you chased after the other boy running down the street. Between the two of you, the crime could be foiled, but they always got away, taunting you as they ran. You get mad at her as you cross your front yard and see her lying out on the yellow towel. You yell STUP"ID"! and LAME! as you circle around hoping she hears you.\\r\\nShe didn’t come play Ghost In The Graveyard anymore, which really made you mad because you were still scared of the dark. You would have to take a small flashlight with you, using it carefully so as not to let the two other boys see you, for they would call you a WHIMP! or a WUSS! That would really hurt.  The game would go on forever. She was a great seeker, and without her it was hard for you to find the boys on your own. While you were tiptoeing through the dark, she would be having a loud party across the street with those damn tennis boys. You would watch their shadows as they swayed back and forth with the music, all of the bodies in the room meshing into one. There would be this pain in your gut, this twisting, binding, sensation that made you have to call the rest of the game off so you could go in your room and lay down. From there, you would watch until the tennis boys leave, which was always way after 10:30—much longer than she ever stayed out with you.\\r\\nThen there was that one time when she kissed you. She really didn’t do that anymore, that’s for sure. The four of you were playing house, not one of your shining moments. You all played in her basement because that’s where her Playskool kitchen set was, and because no one could see you down there. The two other boys were the children and you and her played the husband and wife. She was almost done cleaning up after dinner while you finished putting the kids to bed, when she stepped right in your way and kissed you. It was real gentle, on the mouth, smooth and lukewarm. And at first you hated it. She looked right at you as she pulled away, both of you surprised that it actually happened, her eyes like coins in a wishing well. First, you spat, saying things like EWWW! and GROSS! It was then you noticed that her hair wasn’t pulled back. It was down, flowing onto her shoulders looking like a stream of blonde chocolate. It smelled good too, like flowers and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. You spat some more, rubbing your hands on your tongue trying to get the girl cooties off. And then she started crying. She ran upstairs, the back of her polka dot dress—the one dress she had that she tried to keep nice—kicking up as she tore off toward her room. You felt awful, not because of what you said, but because at that moment you didn’t like the kiss. You wanted to though, maybe.\\r\\nShe never did that again, no sir.\\r\\nShe was sitting outside, her skin a nice basted brown color, the white of the lotion being sucked into the meat on the backs of her legs. You were standing outside by your basketball hoop, shooting some baskets by yourself. The other two boys had stopped coming around soon after she did. You tried calling them, a lot, but they were too busy with after school football games and reading car magazines behind the gymnasium, and all they talked about was trying to get laid. You watched as her tiny fingers turned page after page in some teen bopper magazine, while you have to ran to catch the ball every time you missed, trying to prevent it from rolling under two big pines trees next to the hoop. It was then when you decided you had enough. You picked up the ball and crossed Kimball Street, that tightening feeling returning to your gut. You stand over her, the small straps of her bikini lying carelessly on her golden brown back.\\r\\n“Wanna play some basketball?” you asked, holding the weathered old ball out for her to see.\\r\\n“I’m just too old for that now,” she said, her body not flinching in the slightest.\\r\\nYou walked back across the street alone, heaved up a jump shot that rimmed in and out, and decided to try and hunt for buried treasure by yourself. \\r\\n<em>Nick Ostdick is a fiction writer from the Chicago area.

It feels deliciously like a midnight tryst (does it not?), all the more furtive by its innocuous midday incubation.    And now, with this comparative eternity stretching before us, my whispering narrative finds me grappling for my slim, predatorially sleek piece of mobile technology amid a mosaic of sticky yellow notepaper, whose compound use of defying the very technology it hides and distracting the onlooker with the semblance of effusively creative \"value-added\" labour, maintains my continuous esteem.  \\r\\nDamn.  You caught me multi-tasking.  Four minutes. Reception is un-cooperatively dodgy in this part of the building.  Fine, I will save my next volley in the infinite voicemail loop with Scanlon until after lunch.  I will even delay my text message flirtation with sweet Marcelo from the downstairs coffee bar, of the long-lilting Brazilian eyelashes.  Rearranging sticky yellow notepaper pieces to defy pattern recognition. I spoke too soon – I see bars now where there was a blind \"searching for reception\" icon blinking in the corner of the miniature screen.  It is amazing how you can swivel a little bit on your chair and… well, they just appeared all at once, really.  Kind of like a bar ambush.\\r\\nThree minutes.  I must take comfort in knowing that the bars will be there for me when I am in need.  You must excuse me once again – the screen on my desktop, which has taken the liberty of flashing at me in what appears to be a most aggressive manner – is actually transmitting a raw, desperate plea for help.  Ah! There is a hotline for these things. It''s an automated message. How many robot suicides a year do they believe their profuse thanks-for-clogging-our-phone-lines message is actively preventing?

That is, when corduroy elbow patches finds his smile again, or the botox wears off.  \\r\\nOne minute.  The pressure is on.  Help is nowhere in sight (or within squelching distance of a pan-pipe rendition of Smoke on the Water).  Now I feel guilty.  Let me clarify – it was never my intention to mislead you, nor to subject you to the Help Desk''s impoverished musical tradition.  Recall my initial disclaimer: that this was neither the place nor the time to pen a picaresque confession of my deeds and misdeeds (figuratively) in the style of television delicacies prevalent on cable channels.  I would portray our time together as more of a vignette (as might have been inferred by its informal yet abrupt introduction).

(53, 1, '2020-05-01 18:40:35', '2020-05-02 02:40:35', 'Read.  Read a lot.  Read award winning fiction, critically praised non-fiction, the best in whatever genre you wish to write yourself.  These suggestions abound in writing magazines, and are dispensed by people who know something about the craft of writing. The intention is to flood your brain with wonderful word choices and beautiful phrasing in the hopes that your own writing will follow suit. \r\n \r\nInitially I embraced this advice.  I was glad to have any excuse to indulge myself in more time spent reading. The more I read the more I wanted to read, and I even began to read books in genres I had formerly avoided in order to stretch my writing in new directions. I had not yet collected a paycheck as a writer, but all the reading I was doing made me feel like I was inhaling words and would soon strike pay dirt with my own compositions.\\r\\nI began to focus more on details when I was reading.  Instead of becoming completely immersed in a book, I became distracted by an author ending a sentence with a preposition or using too many adjectives or adverbs.  In one novel that I thought was particularly lovely and effective, the author chose to start a sentence in nearly every paragraph with “but,” something I had always been told was a no-no. \\r\\nI began to question the grammar rules that had been pounded into me during my years in Catholic elementary school.  Why wasn''t it right for me to write a sentence like, “She didn''t know how much she could put up with,” or “It was what I had been dreaming of?”  The very fact that the books I love the most flaunt convention, using whatever words they please in whatever order they choose, seemed to indicate it was time to throw the grammar book out before it did more harm.\\r\\nDisturbing thoughts about my writing started to surface. I began to wonder if the fact that I still felt the compulsion to follow all the grammar rules might be stifling my creativity. Inadequacy and doubt entered the picture when I found I couldn''t step away from the rules others had imposed on me in order to express myself.  I forged on, still writing while trying to ignore the doubts that crept in and intertwined with my phrases and sentences.\\r\\nIn the cruelest twist, reading all the exceptional writing has not done what I had hoped it would do. Instead of inspiring me to write more and write more effectively, it has intimidated me to the point where it is close to defeating me.  Whenever I read a particularly lovely turn of phrase, negative thoughts race in to greet me.  I think such things as, ‘I will never be able to express myself this beautifully,’ or ‘I don’t know how to touch an emotional cord in this way with words.’  Other writers have without question faced these same doubts, but this writer doesn''t know if I have the strength to weather the negative self talk.\\r\\nWhether I abandon my plans of becoming a writer or not, my enjoyment of reading may have become permanently affected.  Picking up a well-written book and seeing it as a symbol of my failure instead of a glorious escape is one dilemma. Even if I am able to overcome that, it is clear I am already unable to read with the abandon I once did. I wonder if I will ever enjoy a book again without picking its grammar and sentence structure apart. \\r\\nIf I continue to write and summon the courage to submit, I might have to shield myself to some extent from well written literature.  Rejection letters will be enough for my self esteem to deal with.  Being faced with extraordinary writing presents yet another sort of rejection. It doesn''t take a lot to discourage my fragile ego - I desire a much thicker skin. But I believe a writer’s ego needs to be sufficiently frail in order to be able to look at ones self and others with all artifice stripped bare.  Confident and cocky individuals are often not in tune with the subtleties of the motives and behaviors of themselves and others.  Sensitive people feel things more keenly, which translates into prose that carries the ring of truth.  I''ve learned to trust my delicate ego for the insights it provides me as I write my stories, and then I attempt to switch to protecting it when the critiques roll in.\\r\\nIn the end I know my threats to curtail my reading of fine literature is an empty one. A love affair with books that began as a toddler cannot be so easily discarded. There must be a way to use fine writing to challenge and improve my own without threatening me and I continue in that search. Reading does put wonderful words into my bank to draw upon and I can certainly use the cash.  So I will continue to read; read a lot; read the best writing I can find to inspire me and try very hard not to pay attention to sentences ending in prepositions.\\r\\n', 'Good Writing.

The day was turning into night, but still  there was just enough daylight that he could see his reflection in the spit-shined windowpane. With his hair combed back, with a slight part down the middle, he asked himself, Will she like my undulating nose and small mouth? He wore his best trousers, with a bow tie and button-down cotton shirt and moccasin shoes that he had ordered through Woolworth''s.\\r\\n\"Kalamazoo, Michigan.\" He turned and faced the conductor, who nodded his navy-blue cap in his direction, and turned to take tickets from the rest of the passengers, most of them men, most of them headed in the direction he was not. The next destination on that train was Albion, Michigan, a town that he had only heard about in passing. The man sitting across the aisle  from him pulled out a corncob pipe. The smell of tobacco peppered his thoughts.\\r\\n\"Kalamazoo. There''s a town that you don''t care to hear much about,\" the man across from him sniggled. That''s where she would be at: Ethel Louise Spencer. Of course, once they were married, that name would become Mrs. William Snodgrass. She would be introduced to other society ladies as soon as he received his photographer''s license.\\r\\nPhotography was such a new device that he could not very well be concerned with the mechanics of what level of social class his profession would afford them when his apprenticeship was completed. All he could concern himself with was the reproduction of the Snodgrass family line so that he may one day pass down his business, should the Lord bless his rightful Episcopalian prayers with an heir. \\r\\n\"Yes, that''s correct,\" he said to the man with the slight arrogance he had been practicing since leaving Detroit. With the delicate air of complacency, he took a handkerchief out of his pocket, and wiped the sweat beads from his forehead. He could hear the scamper of orphaned children scattering like cows on a prairie off the train as they were inspected for work-farmers in Albion. The man across from him said, \"I read an article about them damned orphans in the Detroit Free Press. Them New York Irish ninnies breed them like chattel, and then don''t want ''em. They get on these trains and run wild. Damn brats!\" The man''s red hair flamed as bits of liverwurst fell on his moustache and he coughed up blood into his hand and wiped it on his shirt. Bill thought he saw black-colored teeth with open spots and red sores in the man''s mouth, but he couldn''t be sure.\\r\\n''Could be syphilis,'' a term that one of his clients frequently used when he discussed the various reasons as to why the Irish were giving up their children. He leaned into the aisle to see if there were any empty seats anywhere else. There were none. He removed her sketch from his pocket and studied it. He imagined her to have milky-white skin that he knew must feel like porcelain silk. She probably bathed in the same oils that his clients'' wives bought on their journeys to the Far East: She was an exotic beauty.\\r\\nMuch later, the train pulled into Kalamazoo. The whistle, along with the night-smoky air, let him know that he was in the town. A Negro with the ability to pass with a black tweed suit with a black cap with buttons held a cardboard sign that read, ''Bill Snodgrass Here.'' He walked over to the Negro and handed him his carpenter''s bag that contained long johns, socks, a comb, five-cent candies, and  an advertisement to see Hilda the Fat Lady at the Barnum''s Circus. The Negro, a man named Solomon, opened the back door of the horse-drawn paddy wagon for him. He had finally arrived. The trot through Kalamazoo was quaint and pleasant. The town reminded him of Detroit except for a hill they passed going across the railroad tracks. He saw big Craftsman-style homes on his right and on his left, Irish orphans headed onward with their bare feet stuck out the windows. Solomon looked back at him.\\r\\n\"They''s headed toward the farms. Down by Dowagiac, sir,\" Solomon pointed and waved. \\r\\nBill said nothing. The wagon had not moved because they were stuck at a railroad pass, waiting for his train to cross the tracks and head toward Solomon''s adopted hometown, a fairly magical place named Niles, Michigan, where a conjurer knew more darkness than Stephen Foster.\\r\\nSeveral soap-deficient farm children came up to them to pound on the wagon''s wooden side. \"Please, sir,\" they said, \"spare us some change.\" He reached into his pocket and pulled out his last change: three pennies. He threw them down on the yellow-green grass and quietly laughed into the night air as they crossed the train tracks. One child threw a piece of unclean celery at the wagon, and was quickly slapped by his mother. The horse''s pace quickened into a competitive trot. Bill wanted to fall asleep but all around him was dirt-clumped hay, and Solomon hummed an odd tune that was strangely comforting. He tried to stay awake but he fell asleep anyway — he was exhausted after days of travel.\\r\\nHe woke soon and Bill pulled the sketch out of his left pants pocket again and read the note attached that he had ignored before. He skimmed down to his favorite line and reread it: Sorry for the sketch. Mother says that it''s improper for a lady-in-waiting to take a photograph without her husband-to-be. Will have to accept my apologies. Bill looked over the sketch.  The artist, Ethel''s brother, had captured the angular symmetry of her heart-shaped face. The eyes were only a day-old, and the mouth was also small and unassuming like his. The hair, according to the letter attached, was brown with a slight hint of blonde.\\r\\nThe Negro pulled the horse-drawn paddy wagon behind the house, next to the shed  where the livery was. He opened the door and assisted Bill. \"Right this way,\" he said. He opened the back door where Bill was met by a butler with silver-gray hair and spectacles on a face that reminded him of his favorite author, Mark Twain, whose sketch he had mastered as an apprentice when on his first great lesson on life a few years ago on December 23, 1868, he stood in Young Men''s Hall to view the then-obscure author speak on the heart of man. The lesson he learned was nothing of importance. He learned more from his favorite author by reading than anything else. \\r\\n\"You are Mr. Snodgrass?\" Bill nodded his head. \"Right this way,\" the butler said, and he followed him. He was promptly seated in the front sitting room where a maid was pouring hot tea into a cup and fresh butter cookies were piled on top of a gold platter. Bill had not sat down for two minutes when Ethel entered the room without being introduced. She looked the same as her sketch, only younger and with a black gown on. She took one look at him and to no one in particular said, \"He''s not as handsome as his sketch. He may as well shoot Dan Rice! Oh, Mother, I don''t know if he''ll do,\" and exited the room as quickly as she came. The maid, who had been pretending to fluff Egyptian-lace pillows, handed Bill a platter of cookies. \\r\\nAs the maid left the room, he thought to himself, ''Be patient, Ethel. Marriage is a matter of responsibility and obligation, not convenience.'' Ethel was correct, though; he should have shown her a sketch of himself that did not embellish his best features. Nonetheless, Bill Snodgrass pulled out his pocket watch and began to count the seconds.\r\n', 'An Obligation in Kalamazoo by Piper Davenport', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'an-obligation-in-kalamazoo-by-piper-davenport', '', '', '2020-05-02 19:00:43', '2020-05-03 03:00:43', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/an-obligation-in-kalamazoo-by-piper-davenport/', 0, 'post', '', 5),

Have you got lunch and all you need?” asked his mum.\\r\\n“Of course we''ve got everything. I’m not five, I’m almost eleven!” replied Dylan.\\r\\n“I know you are but there are still things you need to careful of. There are snakes, giant wasps, eels, water scorpions; even some of the plants are deadly. Whatever you do don’t eat anything. You could die if you do. Watch out for ‘Deadly Nightshade’, there’s enough poison in one of them to kill 500 mice!” she explained.\\r\\n“But we’re not MICE!” exclaimed Dylan.\\r\\n“We know Auntie Joy, and we will be careful. We’ll be back for seven. Don’t worry. We’re not going too far” said Danny.\\r\\n“Remember, you can drown in an inch of water. Just take care of each other” said Joy, concerned. \\r\\nAs long as they could remember Dylan and Danny had always spent their summer holidays together. They were cousins. Their mums were sisters whose husbands had decided to buy a run down farm house in south west France. Every year the families spent their entire summer holidays on a building site. The Dad’s, Bob and Bill, worked relentlessly: mixing concrete; building walls; fitting toilets; laying floors and roofing. You name it, they did it. The Mum’s, Joy and Molly, worked tirelessly as well. In fact what ever the men did they did, apart from digging drains as that was “Men’s work”. This left their children free every day to do exactly what they wanted. Of course they did have jobs, but once these were done they were free to explore the fields and woods that surrounded the farm.\\r\\nIt was late morning and the sun was high in the cloudless sky beating out a relentless heat. The farm was quiet. Most of the birds were sheltering from the sun apart from the swallows that shot through the sky, performing aerobatics the worlds best pilots would be jealous of. The boys set off on their bikes, along the dusty road that ran behind the farm, down to the lanes. There were two lanes - one was short; the other long and that was their names: The Long and Short lane. When they were younger the short lane was as far as they went. It ended abruptly, turning into a cow field. The long lane, however, was a different story altogether. The first straight of the long lane was longer than the short lane. After that it meandered through the countryside, with other lanes coming off it. It seemed to have no end. There were always new places to discover, new dens to build. Dylan and Danny were seasoned explorers and had abandoned the overgrown tracks. They now explored the area by water. \\r\\nThat day they were investigating a new stream they had discovered by chance the previous day. It was at the bottom of a corn field. The water was crystal clear and full of life. Danny had discovered the stream whilst stalking a coypu. The giant rat had bolted across the field and into the thick undergrowth that concealed the waterway. It was like discovering a seam of diamonds! It glistened and shimmered in the July sun, the ripples dancing in the light. \\r\\nThe boys sped along the lane, on their bikes, creating dust clouds which billowed out behind them. Arriving at the corn field, they hurriedly dropped their bikes, and set off on foot towards the hidden stream.\\r\\n“I hope we find some dragon fly larvae today,” said Dylan.\\r\\n“They can eat fish you know,” replied Danny.\\r\\n“Don’t I know it! They quite like human too. Last time I caught one it had a go at my finger!” said Dylan with disbelief.\\r\\n“What do you want to find more of them for then?” asked Danny.\\r\\n“I want to put them in the stream nearer the house, so that we will have more dragon flies buzzing around. You know, the really big ones,” replied Dylan frankly.\\r\\n“Good idea. We could take some crayfish back with us too,” suggested Danny.\\r\\n“If there are any,” muttered Dylan.\\r\\nIn front of the boys was a giant elder, its branches reaching for the azure sky. The tree was laden with fruits, its boughs straining under the weight. The clusters of berries formed small parasols that swayed in the warm breeze, providing the boys with much needed shade. At the base of the tree ran the stream. The boys approached it in silence as not to disturb any wildlife. As the stream came into view they heard the distinctive sound of frogs leaping into the water. It mystified them how these amphibians could sense their approach.\r\n  \r\nDylan and Danny had stopped wearing welly boots when exploring water courses. They were not comfortable when cycling and they never came up high enough. Far too many adventures had been cut short because of waterlogged feet. The boys now wore plastic sandals which were perfect. These incredible inventions were virtually indestructible. It did mean that you felt all the living creatures in the stream but this just added to the experience.\\r\\nThey set off up river, following the ditch around the edge of the field. As they waded they fished with Jam jars and nets made from old tights and badminton rackets, scraping the bed for hidden tit-bits. The harvest was bountiful. They caught stone loaches, minnows, sticklebacks, tadpoles, whirly gig beetles, great diving beetles and thousands of fresh water shrimps. However, they found no dragon fly larvae and no trace of crayfish.\\r\\nAs they traveled through the undergrowth, it became thicker and denser. No longer could they see either bank. Brambles and bushes, rushes and reeds hid the sides. The stream appeared to be narrowing. It was being slowly choked by the ever encroaching vegetation. The going got tougher and the boys were now struggling, carefully weaving their way through brambles as thick as your arm; nettles the size of cows and reeds that were like razors. They were thinking of turning back when they spied a sharp turn in the stream ahead.\\r\\n“That looks interesting,” commented Dylan, “we’ll have lunch when we get there.”\\r\\n“Good idea, I’m starving!” said Danny enthusiastically.\\r\\nThe boys were amazed at what they found. As they turned the corner, the vegetation opened up to show a waterfall complete with plunge pool. The water cascaded down rocks coated with mosses into a pool that must have been the size of a small car. Towards the shore were large boulders, surrounded by reeds. All around the pool were low shrubs covered with deep red berries and purple and yellow flowers. In the shallows they could see fish and eels darting and writhing between the rocks and reeds.\\r\\n“What a superb spot for lunch!” exclaimed Danny.\\r\\n“Let’s climb up on to the top and have our lunch up looking over the pool,” suggested Dylan.\r\n \r\nThe way to the top was difficult. The boys had to claw their way through the undergrowth. They were, however, driven by hunger and ploughed on through, tearing off branches and ripping their way between the small trees. Finally they reached the summit. The view from the lip of the waterfall was breathtaking. They could see the whole pool and could make out giant rocks on the bed. In the deep they could make out the shadows and silhouettes of giant eels, much bigger than either had ever seen. \\r\\nThat sat down on the edge dangling the feet watching the beasts lurking in the deep. They got out their lunch and started eating. It was like they hadn''t eaten in weeks, the hot sun and mornings adventures had definitely helped work up an appetite. \\r\\nAfter their lunch of cheese and tomato sandwiches and crisps, they sat chatting soaking in the atmosphere. \\r\\n“This place is the coolest!” said Danny.\\r\\n“I reckon you could swim in there. It’s big enough,” enthused Dylan.\\r\\n“Those eels look dangerous though,” said Danny with concern.\\r\\n“Yes I agree. You wouldn''t take your shoes off would you! Those trees, do you know what they are?” asked Dylan, gesturing towards the small trees that surrounded the pool.\\r\\n“Which ones?” asked Danny.\\r\\n“Those with the bright red berries and yellow and purple flowers,” said Dylan. As he spoke he saw Danny’s face change. He suddenly looked very worried.\\r\\n“I think we could be in trouble,” said Danny.\\r\\nAt that moment Dylan remembered his mum’s words to him earlier that day.\\r\\n“Deadly Nightshade…But we''ve touched it!” he yelled.\\r\\n“Not only have we touched it, but we''ve also just eaten. All the poison on our hands has been transferred to our food which is now inside us,” said Danny.\\r\\n“We’ll be dead in minutes!” panicked Dylan.\\r\\n“I don’t think it works that quickly. We''ve got at least a few hours, maybe a day,” said Danny trying to ease Dylan’s fears.\\r\\nThe boys’ world suddenly started falling down around them.\\r\\n“I’ll never start secondary school,” said Dylan.\\r\\n“I’ll never see Joe Parsons in year 8 again. She’s lush!” replied Danny.\\r\\n“What are you worrying about girls for? We’re going to DIE!” screamed Dylan.\\r\\n“Calm down. Right we need to think. What are we going to do?” asked Danny calmly.\\r\\n“We’re going to die! Do you not understand? It’s too late!” repeated Dylan.\\r\\n“Look we might be able to slow it down. We don’t know how much poison we''ve both had,” said Danny nervously.\\r\\n“I was sucking crisp crumbs off my fingers! I’m doomed!” squealed Dylan.\\r\\n“Right, first things first, let’s wash whatever’s left on us off. Last one in is a loser!” shouted Danny, grinning like a madman. \\r\\nThen Danny did something completely unexpected. He leaped from the top of the waterfall into the pool below. Danny jumped without fear, like a sky diver leaping from a plane. He hit the water with an almighty splash. Water lapped up the sides of the pool, temporarily submerging the edges. \\r\\nDylan wasn''t so confident.\\r\\n“Come on, the water’s lush. Look, we’ll be dead this time tomorrow, let’s make the most of it!” shouted Danny.\\r\\nHe’s right Dylan thought to himself. I''ve got nothing to lose!\\r\\nHe threw himself off the top. He shot through the air like a frog diving for a fly, entering the water with a tiny splash.\\r\\nDanny whooped with joy as Dylan surfaced.\\r\\n“Wow! That was fabuloso!” congratulated Danny.\\r\\n“It might have looked good, but I''ve really hurt my knee,” said Dylan holding back the tears. The boys clambered out of the pool and inspected the wound. Dylan had a long gash along his knee with a nasty graze around it.\\r\\n“I bashed it on the rock. I went too deep. I managed to lift the other leg in time. But this knee just wouldn''t move quickly enough!” winced Dylan.\\r\\n\r\n“It looks nasty, we better get back and get Mum to look at it,” said Danny.\\r\\n“Why? We’re going to be dead tomorrow. It doesn''t hurt that much anyway. Come on, lets jump some more,” replied Dylan frankly.\\r\\nThe boys continued jumping all afternoon. It was bliss. The water was cool and refreshing. They experimented with a variety of different jumps: dives, bombs, somersaults, skids and handstands. They had never been so bold and reckless. \\r\\nThe boys decided to make their way back to the farm. They were exhausted. Sadness flooded their hearts as they left the hidden pool. The waterfall had provided them with one of the best days of their lives. They knew that they would never forget it, but they wouldn’t have chance would they? How could this place be so terrible?\\r\\nThe boys climbed on their bikes and set off home at a more leisurely pace. The birds were back from their midday refuges, singing from every tree, flitting from shrub to shrub, chattering endlessly, whilst getting ready to roost. \\r\\nZooming along the lane the boys talked about their adventures.\\r\\n“I bet I can cycle no handed for longer than you,” challenged Danny.\\r\\n“Are you mad? I am a master of the ancient art of no handed cycling! You are merely my pupil!” boasted Dylan. \\r\\n“Yeah right. Let’s change the challenge then. We’ve got nothing to live for.” Danny paused, thinking of how to make this task more exciting.\\r\\n“We have to race no handed.”\\r\\nThey skidded to a halt. Dylan and Danny started counting down together, like they had done so many times before.\\r\\n“3, 2, 1- GO!”\\r\\nBoth boys started off gingerly, neck and neck. They looked very strange cycling as fast as they could with their arms by their side. Danny started edging forward. They passed by the cow shed, startling the young heifers sheltering indoors. This in turn flushed out four pheasants, which ran in front of the boys. Danny swerved and clipped the front of Dylan’s tire, sending the pair of them headlong into the gritty lane. \\r\\n“Ouch! My elbow!” moaned Danny. \\r\\n“My other knee matches,” observed Dylan, “It could be worse. It could have been fatal.”\\r\\nThe boys retrieved their bikes, straightened their handlebars and saddles, and sat down by the side of the track.\\r\\nWhilst sitting nursing their wounds, the boys noticed a constant trail of hornets flying back and forth past them. \\r\\n“I wonder where they are off to?” commented Danny.\\r\\n“Flying back and forth to their nest I suspect,” replied Dylan. \\r\\n“Shall we follow them? I’ve always wanted to see a Hornets nest,” suggested Danny.\\r\\nDylan considered Danny’s idea. He had always wanted to see a hornets nest. Wasp nests had always fascinated him with their elaborate paper construction which looked so sturdy until you touched it. A hornets’ nest would be so much more exciting, like an alien palace on some distant planet. They were, however, a place where large numbers of hornets could be found, and they were dangerous. \\r\\n“OK, let’s do it,” said Dylan reluctantly.\\r\\n“Right, which way do we go? They seem to be going in two directions,” replied Danny ponderously.\\r\\n“If you look carefully, the hornets flying this way aren’t carrying anything,” noted Dylan, “That must mean that they are flying away from the nest.”\\r\\n“So we need to go that when then!” exclaimed Danny triumphantly.\\r\\nCharging off in the direction of the nest, the boys abandoned their bikes and nets. What would they need them for now? Who knows where the hornets would lead them? They went over fences, through fields, under bushes until the hornets lead them to the pear tree which was opposite the farm house. As they neared the tree, they noticed a constant buzzing floating through the air. \\r\\n“There must be millions of them,” commented Dylan in hushed voice.\\r\\nDanny noticed that these giant wasps all seemed to be entering the tree through a tiny crevice which was roughly at the boys’ eye level.\\r\\n“What do we do now?” Dylan asked. Yes, they had found the nest, but what were they to do with it?\\r\\n“Okay, here’s the plan,” explained Danny. He paused to collect his thoughts and then resumed. “We’re going to find some long sticks. Then we’re going to jam them in the hole. That should get them going. Then we run, faster than we’ve ever run before.”\\r\\n“I thought you we were just going to find it? Why do we have to wind them up?” asked Dylan.\\r\\n“Look, we’re going to die. We might as well live dangerously in the short time that we have left,” replied Danny.\\r\\nSo they searched the nearby hedgerows until they found what they required: two sticks, which were long enough to give them a head start; cow parsley would be perfect. Creeping towards the tree, Danny readied his weapon. \\r\\n“When I say, you run as fast as your legs can carry you. We’ll go back to the bikes and then home.”\\r\\nCarefully Danny, edged his stick to towards the whole. The hornets were already aware that something was not quite right. They had started to buzz around the end of the stick. A hornet landed on the end and started trying to sink its giant sting into it. This attracting another hornet who started doing the same, only this time closer to Danny’s hands. \\r\\n“Careful – they’re not stupid. Eventually they’re going to realize that your hand is what is controlling it!” warned Dylan. \\r\\nThen it happened. \\r\\nHornets started streaming out of the hole, hundreds and thousands of them. To the boys, time seemed to slow down. They looked in horror as the hornets, sped towards them!\\r\\n“RUN!” screamed Danny.\\r\\nDropping the sticks, the boys turned and fled. They dashed across the fields, under the bushes and over the fences. When they got to their bikes, they didn’t stop; they picked them up and started running with them before hopping on. Speeding along the desiccated lane, the boys laughed triumphantly! They had done it – escaped the wrath of the hornets! They’d pretty much cheated death! Simultaneously, the boys realized that they hadn’t escaped the grim reaper. The poison they had ingested earlier was racing through their system, slowly poisoning every cell – death was inevitable.\\r\\n“I had a really good day today Dee,” said Danny sadly, “I can’t believe it’s all going to be over tomorrow.”\\r\\n“I know – but it has been good! We’ve definitely lived life to the full. We’ve taken risks, felt the blood pumping through our veins and pushed ourselves to the limit. It’s been an amazing last day. I think I will die a happy man…” Dylan’s words trailed off solemnly to silence. \\r\\nThe boys turned the corner of the lane for the last time, their hearts heavy. Suddenly a head appeared from a window in the mill.\\r\\n“What have you idiots been doing? Are you completely brainless?” yelled Bob, Dylan’s dad.\\r\\nThe boys skidded to a halt, looking sheepish.\\r\\n“Well, I know what you’ve been doing. I watched you from the top of the roof. What were you thinking?” asked Bob, his voice lowering.\\r\\n“We’re sorry. We were being stupid,” replied Dylan his voice wavering with regret, as he held back the tears.\\r\\n“To cycle no handed along the lane is one thing, but to wind up a whole hornets nest. Well, I’m lost for words. You need to put your bikes away, tidily, and get yourselves cleaned up. It’s straight to bed after dinner for you! Go on clear off!” scorned Bob. \\r\\nCycling off, their tails between their legs, the boys looked at the ground shamefully. What had they done? Being so wrapped up in their adventures they had completely forgotten about their families. They had squandered their last day pulling stupid and dangerous stunts when they could have been spending time with their nearest and dearest. Danny and Dylan put their bikes and equipment away quickly and went indoors.\\r\\n“What have you pair been doing? I don’t really need to ask – your father has told me everything! Look at your knees, was it worth it? You could have really hurt yourself. Worse than that you could be dead! Three stings from a hornet can kill a full grown man. What were you thinking?” asked Molly, Dylan’s mum, her forehead deeply furrowed.\\r\\n”We’re really sorry,” yelped Dylan, before bursting into tears.\\r\\nHis wailing set Danny off, the full implications of what they had dawning on them. \\r\\n“I’ve no sympathy for you! How do you think I would feel if you’d have died today? You can cry all you like. Now go and getting washed and ready for bed, as that’s where you’re going after dinner,” explained Molly, coldly.\\r\\nThis only set the boys off more. If only she knew. Tomorrow she would be crying.\\r\\nThe rest of the evening was uneventful. Danny and Dylan were on the verge of tears throughout dinner, which was a silent, sombre affair. They cleared their plates away without words and went and sat by their parents.\\r\\n“Off to bed then,” said Bill, Danny’s dad, who had been informed of the day’s events. \\r\\n“No reading; lights straight off,” commented Bob.\\r\\nThen the boys did something they didn’t usual do. They hugged their parents’ goodnight.\\r\\n“What’s all this? Feeling sorry for yourselves are you?” asked Molly.\\r\\n“Tomorrow you’re staying on the farm. I’ve got a list of things that need doing,” said Bill seriously. “You can start by moving the gravel from the behind the garage. It’s spreading, all over the place.”\\r\\n“OK dad. Night then,” replied Danny holding back the tears.\\r\\nThe boys got ready for bed in silence, each one lost in their own thoughts. The lights went off and they were enveloped in the inky blackness of their shuttered room. \\r\\n“Good night Danny. You’re the best cousin ever,” said a voice from the darkness.\\r\\n“You too Dee. Sorry about today. I wish they weren’t so cross with us. If only they knew,” said Danny resolutely. \\r\\n“Don’t think about it,” replied Dylan flatly.\\r\\n“Do you think it will hurt?” asked Danny.\\r\\n“Don’t think about it,” repeated Dylan his voice trailing off.\\r\\n“Dylan are you asleep?”\\r\\n“Dylan, can you hear me... Dylan?”\\r\\nDanny woke up to find a brilliant golden light hitting him straight in the face. He rubbed his eyes. Was it true? Was he still alive? He glanced around the room making sure he was in the same place he fell asleep. He was, he’d survived! He leaped out of bed and ran over to Dylan.\\r\\n“Wake up! We’re still alive!” whooped Danny.\\r\\nDylan did not move; he just lay there with the sun shining upon him.  Danny started to panic. Had the poison killed Dylan but spared his own life?\\r\\nSlowly opening his eyes, Dylan grinned at Danny.\\r\\n“Fooled you!”\\r\\nThat day the boys worked hard and spent all their time around their parents. They didn’t complain once; they were happy to spend time with their family.', 'Deadly Nightshade by Owen Knowles', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'deadly-nightshade-by-owen-knowles', '', '', '2020-05-04 19:18:18', '2020-05-05 03:18:18', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/deadly-nightshade-by-owen-knowles/', 0, 'post', '', 4),

But since I’m the one writing this essay, I get to do the talking. And I say I want him to disappear. Not forever, just for a week or so. Ten days, maybe. Two weeks?\\r\\nSee, every winter since before Johnny and I met, I’ve visited a friend in California (or Georgia, Florida, Arizona – wherever she happens to be living at the time). And every fall, Johnny’s gone to Ireland to see his mum. But Johnny’s mum died last year, and my friend is in the throes of finishing her PhD. Neither Johnny nor I have anyone to visit and, as he would say, we’ve been living in each other’s ear holes far too long…\\r\\nIs there a reason he can’t shut off a light behind him? Close a door? Or turn on the damn exhaust fan when he takes a shower? Why does he keep asking me what I want for dinner when I haven’t eaten breakfast yet – have I ever one time had an answer? And, speaking of which, if I so much as smell another plate of chicken curry I swear to god I’ll—\\r\\nLook, I love him, but one of us has got to go. \\r\\nI’ve never understood these couples that claim to miss each other when they’re separated for a single night. (You see? “Claim.” I can’t even bring myself to believe them.) They’re always checking in, reporting their activities, counting the hours till they’re back in one another’s arms. Gag me, I don’t get it. Johnny and I need our time apart. If I try to check in with him when I’m away, he doesn’t answer because he’s out with the boys. If he calls me from the road I’ve got the stereo cranked to eleven, enjoying my empty house too much to listen for the phone.\\r\\nWhen we’ve spent too many nights together in a row, I’ve been known to retire at 6:00 just to get some time away; he’ll fall asleep watching TV in the living room and stay there. We just aren’t hip-attachment kind of people. Putting a little space between us once in a while is how we manage to maintain civility for the better part of our domestic lives. \\r\\nA couple thousand miles every six months or so seems to do the trick. But we’re going on a year. I’d actually started weighing the pros and cons of handing Johnny a packed bag and a credit card and dropping him off at the airport like an abandoned puppy (except for, you know, what would a puppy do with a credit card?) – when I remembered about Mick.\\r\\nMickey, a friend of Johnny’s from back home in Dublin, got transferred to Canada a couple months ago and insisted Johnny visit as soon as they were settled in. Assuming they are settled in enough by now to have a visitor – and they must be by now, how long could it take? – then Johnny could be off as soon as I can book a flight! \\r\\nPhew, now maybe I can finally stop this twitching…\\r\\nExcept I just emailed Mick to ask if I could ship my husband to him for a week or so (or maybe longer) in a month or so (or maybe sooner), and Mick wrote back to say don’t book the ticket. The move isn’t working out. His wife is staying in Alberta but Mickey’s going home to Dublin right away. He didn’t say it in so many words, but it sounds like they’ll be getting a divorce. \\r\\nOh. Well. Gosh. It’s none of my business, but… how? This is a couple that’s been together for thirty years. They were in their teens when they got married, they had children very young, but they made it through all that. The kids are grown now. They’re comfortable, financially. If they survived three decades of tribulation back in Dublin, what could possibly have happened (in Canada, no less) to tear them from one another now?\\r\\nI couldn’t bring myself to ask, of course, but Mickey (who always has been generous with his emotions) volunteered. It’s been coming for a while, he writes. Being alone together in a new place simply forced the issue. Neither of them ever had anywhere to go. They’d been living in each other’s ear holes, driving one another nuts. Putting an ocean between them had become the only way to maintain a semblance of civility for the remainder of their respective lives. You know how it is, he wrote. You know?\\r\\nYes. Well, no. I mean, I do, but— \\r\\nThat’s not what I meant when I said one of us had got to go. \\r\\nJohnny and I are lucky, I suppose, that we know this about our relationship. That I can go to bed at six o’clock, he can pass out on the couch, and we can wake up still loving each other in the morning.  Still, though, it’s true I’ve been a little touchy lately. Just because he asks me the same question five times in a row doesn’t mean I have to shout the answer at him. And I could let him watch the SciFi channel sometimes; I don’t have to carp over it every single night. \\r\\nWhen he gets home tonight I’ll have to tell him about Mick, but first I want him to know how much I love him, how glad I am to see him, how proud I am that he’s part of my life. I’ll tell him I missed and thought about him while he was at work, that I was counting down the hours until—\\r\\nNope, I’m gagging. Can’t do it. He’s making me nuts.\\r\\nThink Mickey’ll be ready for a visitor back home in two months? How ’bout three? Seriously, how long could it take?\\r\\n<em>Erin G.

(60, 1, '2020-05-06 19:34:14', '2020-05-07 03:34:14', 'Things were so very, very different. I was so much more than three years and thirteen days younger. I was a decade younger, perhaps two, neck-deep in a world of money, privilege, international travel and blissful ignorance of so many things. My older brother was invincible, good at everything, impeccable in every way. He was what we all wanted to be, an example forever shining before us. Sometimes I wanted to kick him in the shins, for being so impossible to stack up next to. No matter how hard I trained, how many hours I sunk into my sailing, into anything - he would always come out on top, graceful and un-phased. As if it were all nothing, nothing at all.\\r\\nI used to watch him win races, watch his easy courage and innate skill. Watch with such a complicated mix of loathing, jealousy, awe, respect, and a deep love of who he was, what he did, and how he did it. Case never spoke an ill word to a competitor. He did not hold his sportsmanship haughtily above others, no... He never made anyone feel bad for a bit of smack talk. In fact, he always enjoyed it - would smile a bit out of the corner of his mouth and even laugh from time to time. But he never added to the pile. Ever. He never needed to put anyone beneath him. In fact, I think he wanted them right beside him, so he could beat his equals, not his lessers.\\r\\nEverything for Case is, at its core, a competition with himself and no one else. Sure, he is competitive as they come, but when it comes down to it, it is so much more than a quest for recognition or trophies or money or sponsorship. Part of that is the luxury of our family, our stability, our ability not to worry about the monetary stresses of ''real life'' and just do what we do. But most of it? It is who Case is.\\r\\nWhen everything went up in smoke and spray on May 18th, 2004, his competitive goals simply shifted. Now, it certainly had nothing to do with the hull beside him. Now, it was truly my brother versus himself. Versus the parts of him that no longer seemed his own - the cancer, the injuries, the pain, the inability to turn to training to get him through. No, there was nothing for Case to turn to. There was no handbook, no trick of the trade, no secret. He simply had to get down in the work and take it as it came. No one is better suited for that task than my brother.\\r\\nWe watched him trade punches with the sudden shoddy hand he was dealt. We watched him hit the floor, gasping for wind, so many times. We learned he was not immortal, that he was breakable, just like everyone else. How? How could he be like everyone else? He had never been like everyone else so long as he had lived. It was unsettling, unspeakably difficult, unspeakably surreal. And yet, there it was, in painful black and white before us every day as the colour drained from his face, as his muscles left him and the day to day became nearly insurmountable for him. He lost everything, everything, everything. Everything but his life. And, he has shown, that that was all he needed to hold on to to be able to rise again.\\r\\nSometimes, I see him now, and realize he is more himself, three years later, than he ever was.\\r\\nCase was not the only one to go up in smoke that day. The woman he loved went up as well, with Marty and I beside her. Marty and I came back, only to watch Alex falter and nearly fall - we held our breath as he climbed back from hell, ever so slowly. Callie fell, and we could not catch her, try as we might.\\r\\nSince then, we have risen. A bit worn for the voyage, more than a bit worse for wear. We bring with us evidence of the past, reminders that will haunt tired muscles and aching bones for years to come. But most of all, we bring a bit of wisdom. A bit of understanding that may be beyond our years, but has been a long time coming regardless.\\r\\nHere we are, three years later. With Case strong, tall, and silent beside us. Just the way he has always been. And now, we are back to the frivolous games. We are back to teasing, and betting, and taunting a bit to get the other to bite.

He walked like poetry, the slow grace of his movements rushing through her until all she could do was gasp.  Delete.  He sat on the porch, cheeks stained with tears, and the slow progression of time was marked only by the call of the birds in the trees.  Delete.  He walked out the door, as I stopped running and looked at him in the semi-darkness.  Delete.  He kissed me softly as I sunk into the softness of the bed, feeling it strain as I slowly gave in.  When he kissed me, I thought “Capture this”.  Take a picture.  Run the video camera.  I want to hold onto it.   When he kissed me I knew it was the last.\\r\\nSo I write this to you, unnamed reader, so that I will not forget.  So that I remember.  This is how it happened.  I am seeing him now and I see his Adam’s apple, sharply protruding from his neck, moving closer as the clock makes one excruciatingly long tick toward the next second.  And then his lips are on mine.  Have I told you that his lips are full, round sensuous against a visage shaped like stone?  Those lips, dear reader, are meant for sin.  You don’t believe me, you are laughing; but it is true.  Then his lips are on mine, lightly pressing against my mouth and I want to arch into it and I want to pull him down to me until I don’t know where I end and he begins.  You must think that this is not so special.  You must be thinking, I have had such kisses in my lifetime.  But you are wrong.  I was being kissed and I was no longer there.  I heard the rush of soft rain on the tree outside my window and the insistent scurry of two squirrels cavorting.  But I no longer felt my heart beat and my blood pulse or the tears coursing down my cheeks.  I no longer felt the uncomfortable warmth of the layers of blankets covering my body.   For that moment, I did not exist.\\r\\nStill you say, my most skeptical reader, that I just didn’t perceive those things.  That I did not perceive the wind from the window or the smooth fabric on my skin but I knew that they existed, that there was more to the moment than the tale I am recounting.  I understand that you have these thoughts because you, unlike me, have not experienced this kiss.  I could continue to describe the empty slate of my mind as those lips broke contact, but I will not.  I know you would not believe it.  I will only tell you how it was when I came back.  When I joined the ranks of the living.  My eyes were closed and I did not see him leave but I felt it.  I heard the slow creak of the door accompanied by a slightly louder noise of the wood hitting against the door frame as it closed.  I wriggled a little, feeling the rough soles of my feet hit the smooth skin on the top and stopped.  An alien layer lay between that contact like some impermeable membrane and I was conscious of not being able to reach myself.  My hands slid all over myself, feeling the smoothness of legs and the fabric of the nightgown and the warmth underneath.  My hands moved under the fabric and I expected to feel a familiar sense of pleasure, a rush of blood to the surface capillaries.  But I only felt again the unfamiliar layer of separation.  I tried again with a mounting desperation, first caressing then hurting.  I was pinching the skin like a doctor would a victim of paralysis.  Nothing.\\r\\nSo you see, it was the kiss.  The kiss allowed me to traverse into the world beyond the one you inhabit.  It allowed my long alien fingers to touch the keyboard with rhythm and grace as I write this.  My dear reader, neither am I dead nor am I crazy.  I tell you that I will go on.  Will experience many more kisses, many more intimate moments; meet many more men with a gleam in their eyes.  But I will no longer know this keening, this desire that consumes.  I am settled now and I am sitting up the bed, covers curled over my legs, unable to stop the flow of words from my mind to my fingertips.  How, you are thinking, was he able to cause this change?  You are picturing Adonis, and you are shivering.  You are picturing a god and you too want him.  You are blushing now, so I will correct you.  He is not a perfect man, is not the man I will marry or grow old with.  What then, is he?  He is a man.  He is a man caught up in the journey of becoming whole, not quite handsome, but perfect for me.  And that is it.  That is what I have been trying to tell you.  As he left I realized that he was perfect for me.  You are shrinking now, thinking of putting down this paper, feeling embarrassed for me and a bit disgusted for buying into my fiction.  Because you did believe, my dearest reader, my friend.  You had closed your eyes and vanished into the deepest part of yourself searching, reaching for a similar kiss.  But what now?  You are telling me of your own heartbreak, your own perfect men, and what am I doing?  I am turning away and I am closing my eyes and I am dreaming of the last kiss with the perfect man on a narrow bed in a room with whitewashed walls.

It was an apt choice; most of the pieces were no more than a hundred words or so, beautiful, fragile little scenes that took a few seconds to read but stayed with you far, far longer. The idea was that the stories could fit, literally, in your palm. Typically Japanese.\\r\\nI, on the other hand, am not Japanese. And I''m far from fragile (but my mum thinks I''m beautiful. I hope.) When I first created this site, I was writing scenes and short stories filled with characters I remember from growing up in the suburbs of Manchester, in the north-west of England. You can read about some of them <a href=\"http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/but-why-the-man-by-martin-bell/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/doves-in-flight-by-martin-bell-2/\">here</a>.  Manchester is generally an industrial city (although I think it has changed some now) and my family were, and still are, working people. The people I met in the street, in the pubs, in the markets and especially those I came across as I followed my Dad around on his deliveries were more likely to show you the back of their hand (as in, “Any more lip from you son, an'' you''ll see the back o'' me hand!) than consider the merits of flash fiction crafted by a Japanese Nobel-prize-winning author.\\r\\nMost of the scenes I wrote never materialized into anything more substantial – in fact, most of them never materialized into anything at all, as they''re all still floating in the limbo of a corrupted hard drive at the bottom of a cardboard box on my garage floor. However, I did want to create a place for new writers where short fiction was the norm, where writers could grow and learn and where you could read  work in a couple of minutes that would stay with you the rest of the day.\\r\\nSo there you are. Backhand Stories.

(67, 1, '2020-05-10 20:32:48', '2020-05-11 04:32:48', 'It was reasonably late in my life that I discovered there was a name for my fear of crowded places. And more specifically, the term agoraphobia, upon stumbling over it recently in my Spanish-English dictionary, gave validity to what my family had always considered a silly and embarrassingly illogical concern.\\r\\nAgoraphobia- Fear of crowded, public places like markets (or in my case, beaches). \\r\\nI was fortunate enough as a child to entertain wild and dreamy ideas when it came to planning holiday vacations. When asked where this year''s Christmas break should be spent with my brother and parents, I''d regularly contemplate the most recent grand prize Bob Barker had given away on The Price Is Right. \"How about a relaxing tropical escape to luxurious Graaaaand Cayman?\" I''d say, using a cheesy, almost salesy intonation to my voice. Usually no one listened. \\r\\nHoliday breaks allowed us to see new places and experience new things; a sense of novelty that inspired us to let down our guard and, as a country singer might put it, try ''n live a little. Honey coated cereals, for example, not permitted otherwise in our home, were allowed in the mornings of vacations via small cardboard packages that limited our Fruit Loop or Apple Jack consumption to a muted sugar high. We rented convertible jeeps that we wouldn''t be caught dead driving in the States, for their poor safety ratings and we stayed in houses with pools (a huge insurance liability back at home). We went out to exceedingly expensive restaurants that would normally be the butt of our jokes and we wore polo shirts and flower prints that were about as unnatural as the suntans we displayed on our legs and necks.\\r\\nEven as a young child, I enjoyed, in a sophisticated sort of way, using this deviant theme of doing things outside the box, to safeguard my fears. I never liked crowded beaches though I can''t really say why.\\r\\nTo me, the nicest beach in the world meant nothing if there were more than five people on it. It may sound silly, but I always had a tendency to group crowded beaches, no matter their location or quality, together in a list entitled Places I Wouldn''t Be Caught Dead In, accompanied by the likes of Red Lobster and old haunted prison cells. Belize, Phuket, Laguna, Atlantic City: they were all the same to me unless a tsunami was coming and I had the beach to myself. \\r\\nIt was this fear, this anxiety for packed beaches that kept me far inland when we vacationed to coastal regions, but inherently, it also bred a sort of whimsical pursuit: the search or hunt for something secluded and private and rare.\\r\\nVacation mornings with the family were spent, often under my governance, searching for private bays and coves. Usually, when we''d come across something that might qualify, I''d discard it as \"too windy\" or \"not white enough\" secretly concerned about the fat group of Germans hanging out in the shade. They wore tiny spandex-like bathing suits. I was almost compulsive in my need for privacy and to an extent, my parents took this apprehension into account, before occasionally throwing their sandy novels and beach towels on the floor and saying \"enough is enough already!\" \\r\\nUpon coming across a vacation spot we liked (and coincidentally one which had great secluded beaches), my family enjoyed returning the next year for round two, and then three, and sometimes then four. The only issue though, was that I''d see, before my very eyes, various beaches-which I once considered my own-being invaded. Quiet nooks in places like St. Martin or Eleuthra or Maine slowly becoming inhabited by tourists, whom I''d pass with outraged eyes as if to say, we got here first you know.\\r\\nTo an extent, this natural evolution and crowding of my favorite private beaches of the world made me nauseous. But it was with great, almost poetic timing, that Panama came into my life and offered up an entire new gamut of options. \\r\\nUpon first sight, it was the feeling I imagine an antique collector might enjoy upon walking into an exceptional flea market: a sense of excitement and restlessness: that you want to see everything and go everywhere and you want to do it all at once before anyone else can. I got my first kicks a few years back on the shores of Isla Canas (Los Santos) and San Blas (Kuna Yala), where beaches were about as deserted as my fifth grade piano recitals. I took comfort in looking up and down coastlines and seeing nothing for miles, a kind of panacea for my newly-diagnosed beach agoraphobia. \\r\\nI relished the opportunity to dig my toes into the warm sands of Santa Clara (Cocle) and Red Frog Beach (Bocas del Toro) with no one around and I have no doubt that the ability to do so has subconsciously kept me in Panama ever since. But like any secret, some chatty folks will eventually spread the word and the very isolation that made them so attractive at the beginning will evaporate like an aerosol room freshener, into thin air. \\r\\nIn reality I can''t really blame them nor can I claim to be the first pioneer as there may very well have been some neurotics before me in this quest. But because Panama is so relatively untouched, there still exist a number of secluded beaches to explore. And for that, the beach hunter in me carries on. \\r\\n<em>Matt Landau is the founder of <a href=\"http://www.thepanamareport.com\"> The Panama Report</a>.

You read a lot and start to notice patterns emerging in the culture you inhabit.  This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it can wear you down.  It may be better just to focus on yourself – as Warren Zevon sang shortly before his death “It’s the land of the brave and the home of the free...the less you know the better off you’ll be.”\\r\\nThe cover of the magazine staring back at me is completely filled with a photo of Britney Spears face.  The heading on the cover says Britney Spears: Inside an American Tragedy.  Think about that for a moment – the reality that, at the point of your most difficult personal struggle, a time of immense need, you could look at a magazine (circulation thousands) and seen a crappy picture of yourself with a denigrating label.  I’m waiting for the day someone’s face fills the cover of Time magazine with the heading $542 this year: An American loser!\\r\\nReading through the article, a typical pattern repeats itself, over and over and over: dominating people who care only for their own interests and advancement enter Brit’s world and suck her dry, sending her farther down a path of self-destruction.\r\n<!--more--> \\r\\nIt starts with the hillbilly mother, a woman locked in a trailer-park marriage and looking for a way out.  Brit, the promising daughter, provides a chance for mom to escape living one exit down from Deliverance.  The daughter is corralled through television commercials like a young sheep heading for the stun-gun at a veal factory and eventually lands a spot as a Mouseketeer.  This leads to an album and a hit video, where the daughter is portrayed as a schoolyard vixen, ready to be ravaged.  She’s on her way to slaughter, but no matter – mom can now afford to have someone cut her hair and no longer needs to cook the bologna-string cheese casserole over a wood fire.\\r\\nA new crew of domineers take over and start sucking greedily at the trough.  They quickly push Mom out of the picture.  Double-chins who probably don’t even like music start managing Brit’s career, controlling her every step, dictating the songs she sings, her wardrobe, her image, etc.  She will make the transition from squeaky teen to hostile slut, a change required to ensure future revenues, when and only when they say so.  Away from the photo-ops Brit’s starting to crumble, but the money is too good for the businessmen, who drive Britney’s ascent like a dot com stock.  At this point she’s become a human version of Pets.com, before everyone knows that the stock is heading south.\\r\\nLike rats sniffing out a half-eaten Whopper in a dumpster, the men entering Brit’s life sense opportunity.  KFed trades in a truck for a quarter-million-dollar sports car and spends his days in a basement studio smoking bowls and laying down tracks for a rap album destined to tank.  Dirtbag guys that you wouldn’t trust to empty your Honeybucket come and go, working sordid schemes and plying the contours of Brit’s mounting self doubt.  \\r\\nNo one is real.  No one has ever been real.  Best friends are complete strangers.  They’re just here to dominate and cash in.  The slide continues, becoming more visible every day.\\r\\nNew snakes board the plane.  The ranks of the paparazzi swell with the inevitable meltdown looming large.  They’re even coming from the Middle East for the spectacle, hoping to cash in, God willing.  Breakdowns are very good for business and Brit provides a growing portion of gossip magazines’ revenue.  Web businesses proliferate and traditional news outlets add reporters to the Brit beat, not wanting to be seen as “old media.”  When Britney appears on the cover of The Atlantic Magazine, the very last place you’d expect to see those enormous sunglasses, it’s obvious that everyone is gunning for a piece of the action.\\r\\nBrit is one of America’s few remaining growth industries and it’s almost time to dust off Barbara Walters for an interview. She is now a one-person economic bubble, and everyone wants to cash in when she pops.\\r\\nMom re-enters the picture, throwing a block and taking attention off her older daughter.  A truly caring parent, she sells photos of Britney’s pregnant teenager sister to a magazine for a cool million.  The alleged father lays pipe for a company nearby the family’s mansion.  The attention shifts briefly, but soon swings back to the real gold mine.\\r\\nDistant relatives from the swamp start giving interviews and professing their concern.  They might be legitimate, or they might be trying to sell their stock before it becomes worthless, it’s impossible to tell.  But it doesn’t really matter – it’s too late.\\r\\nThe end comes quickly.  Hospital visits, courtroom sagas, restraining orders – these are the last recourse for vulnerable people trapped in a world where genuine people are non-existent and predators abound.\\r\\nMost of us can’t sing for shit and we don’t know how to dance.  There’s nothing creative about us and we plod through our lives feeling simply regular.  The last exciting thing we experienced was getting President’s Day off.  Brit can dance and can sing, and we hate her for it.  So we dominate her.  We use her to make a few bucks and add some temporary excitement to our lives.  We tear her down to feel creative and lift ourselves up.\\r\\nWe’re the insane ones.\\r\\nIn no time at all, a decade or so, we’ve ground her to dust.  The predators have killed the golden calf and are shopping around for a new one, another human bubble to feed the pain industry that never stops growing.  Watch out Miley, they’re coming for you next.\\r\\nIn a world of predatory greed, Britney, like so many others, never had a chance.  She was just too profitable.

(70, 1, '2020-05-12 20:58:56', '2020-05-13 04:58:56', 'Sometimes the name they give you is all wrong.  My paternal grandmother’s name was Nava, which, in Hebrew, translates to “beautiful.”  In the biblical Song of Songs, it says, “Thou art beautiful [nava], O my love, as Tirzah, beautiful [nava] as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.”  By the time I met my Nava, she wasn’t quite beautiful, or terrible.  She was essentially a shriveled up little raisin in a modest, tweed skirt and thirty-five-year-old glasses.  She was certainly sweet and cute, and raisiny, but I’m not sure she was beautiful.  I suppose at one time she was—her husband certainly thought so anyway.  \r\nOne day my father and I were talking about names, for some reason, children’s names; what you name your children.  I asked him if, when my mother was pregnant with me, he’d ever brought up the idea with her about naming me after his own father.  He exploded at me.\\r\\n“Gabriel!  What are you, fuckin’ stupid?!” he asked, rhetorically, I hope. \r\n \r\n“Well, Dad, I mean, you…” I began.\\r\\n“Look Gabriel; having a child is a huge responsibility, okay?  You can really fuck a kid up right from the beginning if you call him the wrong thing,” my father explained to me.  I protested.\\r\\n“The ‘wrong thing?’  Dad, you know, he was your father.”\\r\\n“So?” he frothed.  “He’s still my father, and you are my son, and it’s a terrible name so why would I do it to you?  MoRAD?” he roared, punching out the last syllable each time like a veteran heavyweight.  “You think I wanted to name you MoRAD?!  Next you’ll say I should have named you after me.  Efraim,” he said contemptuously of his own identity.  “Another fuckin’ retard name!”\\r\\nMy father, finished for the time being, got up from the dining room table, randomly announced that he was going to “The Camera Shop” and left. \\r\\nI didn’t know what the hell was the matter with him.  His bombastic, Israeli rants are a product of the desert from which he came, and are just meant to be endured and accepted.  He blows up all the time, like a rear-ended Pinto, but locating the catalyst usually proves a superhuman investigative feat.  I didn’t figure this one out for a while.  \\r\\nA few days ago I was sitting on my wife’s futon leafing through her Hebrew/English Dictionary.  This is the type of book I’m pleased that she has because it is also the type of book I would never spend fifteen cents on myself but that I secretly find interesting.  I, like any mature, serious-minded beneficiary of higher education, immediately looked for the translations of the words “penis” and “vagina” only to be thoroughly disappointed that this particular dictionary did not even list words at all, though the editors did, apparently, believe earnestly that the translation for “abundant breasts” (khazeh) shofe’a was a pertinent and necessary inclusion.  I looked for the translations of our names.  There was nothing for Gabriel and there was nothing for Efraim.  Then I remembered.  Him.  MoRAD.  I turned to the “M’s” and there it was:\\r\\n<em>(ba) MORAD (adj.): “on the way down.”</em>\\r\\nI closed my eyes and put my hand to my head.  He was right.  My grandfather never had a chance.  He was fucked over, as my father had put it, right from the beginning.\\r\\nDespite Nava’s beautiful name and in-step with Morad’s pessimistic one, they both suffered gravely from a type of psychosis known as vascular dementia before they mercifully died.  They lived in Australia and I lived in Pennsylvania, so I never saw their pitiful and piteous decline and descent into the dark.  In fact, I never met my grandfather.  My grandmother I was fortunate enough to meet when she was still basically together.  Like I said, she was very small.  \\r\\nThe two of them fell ill and expired prior the beginning of my career as an Emergency Medical Technician.  Because of this, I suppose, my perspective on their illness was not one formed by repeated exposure to these kinds of psychological destructions, but was a raw, emotional and desperate view, the view of an uneducated boy losing his grandparents.  After their diagnoses, I watched my father peerlessly for signs of forgetfulness, inattention, listlessness, wandering and confusion.  Although I know now that vascular dementia is not hereditary, I watch for changes in my own mentality, too.  I worry when I feel my brain losing focus, glazing over or getting fuzzy about one thing or another.  Maybe I’ve just been an intellectually unstimulated EMT for too long.\\r\\nSince I’ve started this job and have seen all kinds of age-induced dementia, the thought of watching my own father lose his mind still petrifies me.  The thought of going crazy myself, however, I no longer find troublesome.  I read an article in a magazine just the other day about a physician who specialized in gerontology.  In his vast career, he had examined and diagnosed thousands of patients with Alzheimer’s.  Recently, he wrote, he had been having memory and attention lapses himself and, after these problems worsened, he self-diagnosed Alzheimer’s.  While he saw another physician to have his suspicions confirmed – which they were – he already knew.  Worse infinitely than knowing the diagnosis; he knew the future, his future, and it’s not pretty.  Anything that involves peeing yourself and failing to recognize your children never is.  \\r\\nThis physician, still in the beginning of his descent, wrote lucidly and placidly about the disease and its effects on the brain and on the body.  He talked wistfully about the damage it had started to do to him, and he was candid with the reader and with himself about what it still had left to do.  I envied him as much as you can envy anyone with Alzheimer’s because I wanted to be as at ease with Fate as he. But I wrestle with illness and death in the daylight and the dark and becoming an EMT in no way helped exorcise those demons.  In many ways, they made them all too real.  In the realm of Alzheimer’s and dementia, though, perhaps my experiences with the geriatric psychiatric patients served to allay some of my fears about insanity.  Many people would argue that dementia isn’t funny, and, of course, when it’s you dealing with the demented parent or spouse, it’s not.  However, from the detached view of the EMT on a psych transport, when your elderly, female patient is demanding that you stop the ambulance “in the name of the United States Government and the Continental Congress,” it’s difficult to keep a straight face in the moment, even though you’re confronting real human tragedy.  I hope that finding that funny doesn’t make me a monster; I hope it makes me human.\\r\\nAs I write this, the date of my marriage to Ali is a mere fifty-odd days away.  Approaching this date of sublime happiness, there is also an element of sadness.  We are melding two families, and both have a history of mental illness.  One or both of us could wind up losing it, and that is frightening to me.  The children that I hope to make with her could wind up losing it, too.  I have seen what happens to people when they lose it.  It gets, well, lost.  I think about our vows.  We vow to love each other and help each other through sickness and in health, through it all.  We promise to love and honor and respect each other no matter what.  But what happens when you pledge your love to someone eternally and then, one day; he or she is not that person anymore?\\r\\nBen was lying facedown on a small sofa at Macomb Hospital’s Behavioral Health Unit.  He was wearing a gray tracksuit, though it was highly unlikely that he was going to be participating in a marathon anytime soon.  His gray hair was strewn this way and that and it stuck to the pillowcase once he sat down on the stretcher.  He had bits of egg and what looked like syrup – at least, I hoped it was syrup – on his jacket front and crystallized eye-boogers encrusted his eyelids.  It was two fifteen and he’d probably been sleeping all day.  And why not?  Nothing else to do.  There was Scrabble in the Unit’s game-room, but I didn’t observe any potential companions that looked up to a Triple Word Score anymore than Ben did.\\r\\nWe were taking Ben to a very upscale facility that specialized in “eldercare” and so this piqued my interest a little bit.  I am a very nosey person and, when I know we’re taking someone to a retirement home that has a yearlong waiting list to get in, I want to know a little bit more about the individual we’re taking there.  Maybe he married money, maybe he’s a war profiteer, maybe he’s a former member of the Johnson administration; I just want to know, that’s all.  Because Ben didn’t speak to me, I could snoop through his file.  I had no compunction about doing this.  Occasionally there was something in there I actually needed to know.    \\r\\nThere was the usual bullshit: medications, allergies, lab results, safety checks, vital signs, nursing notes.  I usually skip all this if I’m reasonably sure the patient isn’t going to croak during the ride.  I flip and flip through the pages until I get to what I’m really after: the physician’s narrative report.  Ben’s physician’s report shocked me so much that I pulled out my journal and copied it verbatim.  Sue me.\\r\\n“Ben ****** is a seventy-six year old Caucasian male with advanced Alzeheimer’s-related dementia.  He is essentially non-verbal and is currently incontinent of bowel and bladder.  Born and raised in England, apparently he was very smart as a child and got a full scholarship to the Sorbonne University in Paris.  After he graduated, he became and engineer and eventually came to the United States in the 1950s and became a Chief Executive for a company.  The patient retired when he was 60, at the beginning of his dementia.  The patient used to enjoy playing tennis and reading books.  Apparently at one time he could read forty books in one week which is, of course, quite an achievement.”    \\r\\nNow going two hours without soiling himself would be “quite an achievement” for Ben.  I became deeply depressed after reading, and copying, the physician’s narrative.  The report went on to say that Ben’s wife was “quite active and independent”.  I wondered briefly how exactly that was relevant and it annoyed me that the physician had put that in there, almost as if to mock Ben and his deplorable mental condition.  I surmised that the doctor who wrote the report was probably schtupping Ben’s wife.  I resented being exposed to this information and paranoid fantasy.  I felt ugly, like an intruder, like this was something nobody was supposed to know.  Now, of course, that I knew what he had been and now that I knew what he had become, I wanted to know more and more and more.  I wanted to know about the first moment double-breasted, pinstriped Ben fucked up in the office or at a high-power meeting.  I want to know the first time he looked at Bob but said, “Jim”.  I wanted to know the first time the phone rang and he answered the stapler.  How did this Goliath get taken down?  By a little neurological atrophy?  It didn’t seem possible.  If it got Ben, if it got Reagan, if it got my Morad and Nava…  \r\n	\r\nIt got Sally, too.  Actually, her name was “Edwina” but sometimes the name they give you is all wrong, so she asked to be called “Sally.”  I guess, if my name was “Edwina” I’d ask to be called Sally, too.  Sally looked ancient.  If you were traveling in an unsafe neighborhood with Sally as your companion, you could hide all your spending cash in the lines in her cheeks and no mugger would ever find it.  Her forehead creases looked like the ridge around a piecrust.  The fact that Sally weighed under a hundred pounds didn’t help her appearance much.  If you passed wind near her, she’d probably disintegrate; not to mention get a little indignant. \r\n	\r\nAt the nurses’ station, I asked all the appropriate questions, and some inappropriate questions, about the patient.  These included her last set of vitals, her overall disposition and, of course, her favorite color.  I never do anything with that information, I just like to know.  The charge nurse made a big deal about the fact that Edwina likes to be called “Sally.”  I asked why.\r\n	\\r\\n“Who knows?  Everybody likes to have a nickname,” the unit clerk said.\r\n	\r\n“You mean like ‘Whitey?’” I asked.  The unit clerk stared at me.  She was black.  Whoops.  “No, I mean—like Whitey Ford.  The baseball player.  Not—I mean—not, like… you know.”\r\n	\r\n“Cracker?” she offered.\r\n	\r\n“Right.  Not like that.”\r\n	\r\nThe transport was uneventful.  Sally, fortunately, was communicative, so that made it at least a little more interesting.  We were able to chat a bit about this and that; she was even somewhat coherent.  She told me that she used to be a first grade teacher.  For forty-six years.  I told her that Ali used to teach pre-school.  \r\n	\r\n“That’s a nice age,” Sally said.  I agreed.  I had met all of Ali’s students each of the three years she taught at a Quaker school.  I liked these kids.  It was a great age.  Much better, I hasten to add, than eighty-six.  If you asked Sally I’m sure she’d tell you so.\r\n	\r\n“Why do they call you ‘Sally’?” I asked, because there was a lull in the conversation.  Because I wanted to know.\r\n	\r\n“Everybody asks me that,” Sally said, smiling a crinkly smile.  “When I was a little girl, there was this popular song called ‘Pretty Little Blue Eyed Sally’.  That became my name.”  \r\n	\r\nAs an EMT, you don’t often look into patients’ eyes.  You look at their charts, you look at your paperwork, you look at their ankles for signs of edema, you look at their chest to make sure they’re breathing.  You watch their jugular vein pulsing in their neck to make sure blood’s still flowing.  If you look in their eyes, it’s a cursory glance to check pupil size and response, to make sure the patient isn’t stroked out or coked up.  You look in patients’ eyes, but you don’t look into them.  That’s too weird.  But, after Sally told me she got her nickname from a song called “Pretty Little Blue Eyed Sally,” I looked into her eyes.  Blue Topaz couldn’t hold a candle to these eyes.  It’s kind of a strange feeling, being twenty-six and saying that about a woman who’s sixty years your senior, but it’s true.  They were sharp and strong and clean and bold, and it required no stretch of the imagination whatsoever to put those eyes into the head of a precocious eight year old, or a coquettish sixteen year old, or a scholarly thirty-one year old, or a wizened sixty-five year old.  Uncomfortable, I looked away.  \r\n	\r\n“It must have been a nice song,” was the stupid thing I thought to say.\r\n	\r\n“Oh, yes,” she said.  “And so that became my name.  I never remembered the name Edwina until I started parochial school and the teacher called out ‘Edwina!’  Well, she was looking at me,” Sally said, in mock astonishment.  I smiled.  “I said, ‘That’s not my name.’  When I got home that day I told my mother, ‘I’m not going back to that dumb school—they didn’t even know my name.  My mother asked ‘What did they call you?’  ‘Edwina’ I said.”  She said it as if it were a curse word.  “‘That’s your name,’ my mother said.  Well, I didn’t know that.  I don’t especially like Edwina either.  So I go by Sally.”\r\n	\r\nWhen I got home from work that day I went to the computer and did a search for “Pretty Little Blue Eyed Sally”.  While I couldn’t find any song from that era with that exact title (she does have dementia after all) I was able to find two versions of the song “Blue Eyed Sally”, and the one that gave her the nickname that stuck for over half a century was either recorded by the duo of minstrel performer Al Bernard and ragtime legend Russell Robinson in 1926, or by Vic Meyers, a ukulele performer of the same vintage.  Regrettably, I wasn’t able to find any lyrics.  So the words “Pretty Little” aren’t in the title.  So what?  Maybe that’s how Edwina sees herself: as little.  As pretty.  As Sally.  And who am I to say anything about that anyway?\r\n	\r\nThere are still days when I get scared about going off the deep end and winding up in the Behavioral Health Unit myself.  I fret and fuss about whether it’s going to be Ali visiting me, slumped over in the glider or me visiting her, slumped over in the glider, or whether we’ll occupy the stain-resistant loveseat together, crapping ourselves and muttering about the nurses as we drool on each others’ sweater vests and hold gnarled hands, our orange blossom wedding bands barely clinging to our deteriorating fingers.  I don’t know what happened to Ben, the tennis-playing, book-devouring CEO, and I don’t know what happened to Sally or to Edwina, and I don’t know what’s going to happen to us.  I just hope that, when it comes time for me to go on the stretcher that the EMT in the back cares just enough to snoop through my file or look into my eyes to maybe find out who I was before I started on the way down. \\r\\n<em>Gabriel Nathan is an Emergency Medical Technician who worked for a private, for-profit ambulance company that contracted with hospitals and other facilities to transport, among others, patients with emotional disturbances.

(71, 1, '2020-05-13 21:25:48', '2020-05-14 05:25:48', 'The banquet room was dark and crowded.  The walls stood dim and abyssal, wrapped in waves of glossy fabric cascading across the rippled periphery, ocean blue and glacial, like the walls of ice box covered in cold satin, glazed in indigo. \\r\\nMaggie, noticing that her reception was enjoyable for all in attendance, and having just arrived from the ceremony, made herself look in the direction of Paul, who since the service had been sitting in the corner of the clubhouse’s dining room at a table draped in power blue tablecloth.  He was talking to a girl with blonde hair, her breast welled-up tight and cleaved taut above a push-up bra, like twin canned hams, catching the errant attentions of several young men not bothered enough to look into her eyes.  Paul’s posture was lax, shoulder blades pressed against the back rest of the chair in which he slouched, legs crossed beneath the smoke slowly streaming off the end of a cigarette he held away from his face like a dirty diaper.  Maggie turned and inhaled as deeply as her tight corset would allow, and then, squinting her eyes, looked around the room at the lively swarm of guests she had invited to celebrate her marriage.  \\r\\nShe paused for a moment, then instinctively, she turned to where Paul sat, puffing and chatting with the blonde, watching the guests on the shiny, lacquered dance floor in the middle of the room.\\r\\n“Why hello,” Maggie said, grabbing Paul’s wrist.  “Get up,” she said.  “I want you to dance with me.”\\r\\n“Hello there. And why is that?” he said, bashfully, having been caught off-guard.  \\r\\n“Oh, because – you look so handsome.” And Paul rose, offering no resistance as he followed her from the table to the dance floor across the room, at the same time managing to quickly milk the remaining embers from his smoke before stashing the butt on the tray of empty champagne glasses, all in stride. \\r\\nIt was warm on the dance floor beneath the florescent spotlights of blue and white.  Maggie turned and met Paul’s hands.  They held one another at arm’s length.  \\r\\n“Paul, honey,” Maggie said, “Thank you so much for being here.  It means a lot that you came.”\\r\\n“Nonsense.  I wouldn’t even think of being anywhere else,” said Paul, trying to pick-up the rhythm of Maggie’s sway as she led.  “I’m terribly happy for you and – besides – it’s good to see you.”  \\r\\n“I know and I’m glad,” she replied, attempting to focus on his words. “It has been so long.”  Their voices were distorted, drowned out by the music ringing off the stage and the relentless chatter of the surrounding guests.\\r\\n“Jack is so good to me.  He’s a friend of Ray Dempsey,” Maggie said.\\r\\n“I don’t know him that well,” Paul replied modestly.  She didn’t respond.\\r\\nAfter only a brief minute into their promenade, the music stopped.  The band graciously nodded to the crowd before leaving the stage and the heavy dance floor dispersed as the guests left in search of something to drink.  Only a few lingered.\r\n  \r\n“Well, I think I should make the rounds – thank people,” Maggie said.\\r\\n“Hold on for a second,” said Paul.  “Give yourself a moment.”\\r\\n“So, since when have you become friendly with Mr. Dempsey?” he asked.\\r\\n“Since awhile.  Since Jack and I started dating,” said Maggie.  “He’s a great guy, don’t you think?”\\r\\n“I suppose he’s alright.  I don’t know him very well.  Never associated with him and that crowd.  They were ahead of my time, you could say.”\\r\\n“Oh, yes.  Well, I couldn’t remember,” she said, looking around.  “I really ought to thank some people.”\\r\\n“Yeah, well, I remember him.  Slow down.  The party’s not even kicked-off,” said Paul.  “Talk to me a while before your new hubby whisks you away.”\\r\\n“My what?”  \\r\\n“Your hubby – your husband.  You’ll have the rest of the evening to thank people.”    \\r\\n“Of course,” said Maggie.  “But everyone is eating now and with everyone seated – honestly – I ought to say hello.”\\r\\n“But I’m your old friend who has traveled far to be here and –.”\\r\\n“I know, but—.”\\r\\n“Where did you meet this boy anyways?” he chimed in quickly.\\r\\nMaggie conceded and smirked amorously at Paul who was grinning back in anticipation of her reply.  Suddenly, from the corner of the room, the blonde girl shrieked with laughter as two college boys circled like sharks on either side of her, joking with one another, gazing deeply into her chest.  Maggie watched her.\\r\\n“I said where did you meet this boy?”\\r\\n“Oh, we met last year, through mutual friends,” she said.  “He begged me to marry him until I finally agreed.  You know the story.”\\r\\n“Well, what I mean is, what did he do to – how do you say – win your over?”\\r\\n“Gosh.  I don’t know, Paul.  I suppose he made me feel important. I fell in love.”\\r\\nAgain, the blonde chirped hysterically, basking in the boozy attention she was collecting. \\r\\n“Love, huh.  Well, you’ve fallen in then?”\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n“Love,” he echoed the processed answer she proposed.\\r\\n“I married him.”  \\r\\n“Of course, why wouldn’t you?”\\r\\n“Oh. It’s not that,” said Maggie, detecting the condescension in Paul’s tone.  “It’s that I felt…that he made me feel like the only girl on the planet – made me feel that no one else could ever make me feel that way.”\\r\\n“Ah – I see.  That sounds a bit odd.”\\r\\nShe paused, dwelling on his remark, unsure of how it was intended.\\r\\n“What does that mean?” she asked.\\r\\n“I said that sounds odd, if you ask me.  But I imagine it’s a difficult thing to explain.”\\r\\n“It is.” She stated this confidently.\\r\\n“So – How did he do it?”\\r\\nCackles sprang-up once more from the blonde.  Maggie focused on her, avoiding eye contact with Paul who, in the middle of his flirtatious interrogation, had grown less aware of the activity fluttering around him.   \\r\\n“What?” she said.\\r\\n“I asked – how did the man propose?”\\r\\n“Oh, I don’t remember.  He did it the way people do.”\\r\\n“Well – that strikes me as odd as well.” \\r\\n“And why is that?”\\r\\n“That is because I imagine it’s a moment that a bride would remember more intimately.  That’s all.  Don’t you think?”\\r\\n“I think that every bride is different,” she said.\\r\\n“Who are you looking at anyways?” Paul said, glancing over his shoulder.  “What’s so fascinating over there?”\\r\\n“No one,” Maggie said.  “Nothing.  I believe I need something to drink.”\\r\\n“Well, well. That’s the best idea I’ve heard all day,” he replied enthusiastically.\\r\\nPaul gently touched her arm at the elbow and steered her around in the direction of the wet bar.  The motion appealed to him and, with her assent, it felt all the more natural.  They walked single-file through the congested dining room.  Maggie followed him through the surrounding crowd. \\r\\n“Make way everyone!  Make way.  The bride would like something to drink,” he announced.\\r\\nThe line of guests parted and made way for Paul who ordered two drinks.\\r\\n“I think,” Maggie said into his ear, “I’ll get some air on the terrace.  It’s stuffy in here, anyways.  Too many bodies.”\\r\\n“Alright. I’m following you,” he replied.\\r\\nThey walked towards the glass door to the terrace.  Maggie led the way, rearranging her bangs in its transparent reflection before the door was opened by the porter who had stood in the same place all evening, acting when called upon  Paul followed, carrying a glass of seltzer water in one hand and a scotch in the other.\\r\\nThe terrace was empty.  Several citronella candles lined the railing of the deck which overlooked the eighteenth hole of the club’s golf course.  It was daylight still and the contrast between the dead Bermuda grass of the fairway and the lush of the putting green was noticeable.  Maggie was immediately aware of the cool air on her skin as she stepped out into the autumn air.  She listened to the muted volume of the noisy guest pilfering around inside through the building’s brick exterior.  It was cold, but she walked across the terrace, leaned casually on the iron banister, and inhaled deeply through her nostrils before turning to look at Paul behind her.\\r\\n“Here is your drink, Madame,” Paul said, handing her the glass of seltzer.  She drank it quickly.\\r\\n“Goodness...doesn’t it feel so much better out here?  Just feel the air.”\\r\\n“Certainly does,” Paul said, after a sip of his drink.  He exhaled with his mouth open, as if to broadcast his refreshment.  \\r\\nThey stood quietly for several moments and surveyed the manicured landscape below.\\r\\n“Can you hear that?” Maggie said.  “The band is back on stage.”\\r\\n“Yes, I can.  Maybe they’ll play something good this time.”  He walked over to the window and peered in.  Maggie watched him.  By the soft light of the citronella, she saw him cup his free hand around his eyes to cut down the refraction of his reflection on the glass.\\r\\n“Nope,” he said over his shoulder.  “It’s the same ol’shit.”  He laughed.  \\r\\n“Oh please.  It’s not that bad.  Come here a minute.”\\r\\nHe walked over to where she stood.  They listened to the sound of band’s guitar.  \\r\\n“What is it?” he asked.\\r\\nShe paused, beaming, looking relaxed, while gazing out at the amber and gold leaves of the trees lining the fairway.\\r\\n“Just feel how nice it is out here,” Maggie said.\\r\\n“Yes, we’ve already gone over this.”\\r\\n“I know, you jerk.”\\r\\n“Now why am I a jerk?”\\r\\n“Some people, ah-hem,” she said, “are too sarcastic for their own good.”\\r\\n“Oh.  I see.”\\r\\n“I’m sure you do.  How would you like it if someone mocked everything you said?”\\r\\n“Not sure, really.  Never happened,” Paul said with a feigned arrogance that made her smile. \\r\\n“Well, I think it would drive you insane.”\\r\\n“I don’t think so.  I think I could take them on if it came to it.  Besides – I’m mad enough as it is.”\\r\\nHe swallowed another weighted mouthful from his glass and watched the hot flames of the candles dance above their Palmolive-colored wicks in the outdoor air.  \\r\\n“So what do you do when you back come home, anyways?” Maggie asked.  \\r\\n“You mean besides attending other people’s weddings?”\\r\\n“I saw that one coming,” she said, almost lightly.  “Yes, beside that.”\\r\\n“Indeed.  I don’t know really – spend time with the family, I suppose.  And they spend money on me.”\\r\\n“Mmm…That must be nice.”\\r\\n“It is.” \\r\\n“You know,” Maggie began, “It’s nice to have you back.  I’ve missed our talks.  Have you ever though about moving back?”\\r\\n“I do from time to time.  But I’ve outgrown the place, the people, you know.”\\r\\n“Oh come on,” she said.  “I know you miss all of us.”\\r\\n“Of course I do,” he replied, wondering who us was.  \\r\\nThey stood in silence.  \\r\\n“You want to know something,” Maggie said suddenly, “you remind me of one of those old western movies, of one of those cowboys who rides into town when there’s trouble happening.  You know.  Sets things straight, then rides off into one of those hazy purple sunsets, guitar music and everything.”\\r\\n“Oh yeah?\\r\\n“Ha – like some outlaw.  Good grief!  What am I saying?”\\r\\n“What’s the matter with that?  Those men are heroes, aren’t they? ”\\r\\n“Nothing at all.  Only you can’t forget: that sort cowboy never really wins.  He never gets rich.  He rides off alone, wanders around the desert like some nomad with a horse.  And, well, he never looks that happy.”\\r\\n“Yeah,” said Paul, “Well, let’s not worry about John Wayne – or his horse.  Let’s have our drinks and enjoy this air that you’ve been talking so intensely about.”\\r\\n“I don’t believe I have anything left.  I chugged it all down, I think,” she said, holding her glass up to her eye-line examining it.  \\r\\n“No worries, I still have mine.”  He smiled and leaned on the banister with his elbows, dug into his pocket for his cigarette case, drew one from under the metal clip, tapped it out, and lit it on the nearest citronella.  He took a heavy drag, listening to the paper crackle beneath his nose.  He remarked that it was, in fact, a beautiful night, that it was good to be home, and that he would be sad to leave the following day.  He finished his cigarette and flicked it over the railing.   \\r\\nMaggie noticed the angle of his brow hanging down as it curled dully above his tired eyes, revealing his inebriation.  She recalled how familiar his expression was.    \\r\\n“So,” Maggie began, watching Paul, waiting for him to finish his ritual, “when did you begin to smoke, huh?”\\r\\n“At about nine – ten o’clock this morning,” he replied.  “That’s usually when I begin.”\\r\\n“Uh-huh.  I should have seen that one coming as well.  You know, that’s terribly bad for you. And it’s disgusting.”\\r\\n“Terribly bad?  I rather think it’s terribly good,” he said sharply, attempting to deflect attention, as he always has, away from himself.\\r\\n“So Mrs. Jack Ethridge – how does it feel to be married?”\\r\\n“Well – it’s a relief, I suppose.  He wonderful man, owns his own business, a printing company, simply adores me.”\\r\\n“He’s quite older than you, Maggie, isn’t he?” he said.  His tone, uneven and rhetorical.  \\r\\n“Oh, let’s drop that business, Paul.  You know me.  I hate looking at people in terms of such things.  I’m happy.  He makes me happy.  What else could matter?”\\r\\n“Yes. Well, I hate to put my two cents in – especially when I’m not that well acquainted with the parties involved – only it seems to me that – not to say the man is old, but rather, you’re so young.  After all, I mean.”\\r\\n“I’m not young,” said Maggie.  “I’m certainly old enough to love and marry whomever I choose.”  \\r\\n“Love,” Paul repeated, his eyes fixing themselves on the fairway.  “I guess love is an attractive thing to be in.  I wouldn’t know.  I think I would like the term better if people used it a little more sparingly.  I mean – to me anyways – it always sounds a bit artificial when you hear it branded about so – what’s the word – leisurely.  I don’t know.  I could be wrong.  Everyone says it, I suppose.  Geez.  I can only imagine this predatorily desire people have to use the word on any ol’inanimate thing.  You know me.  I honestly don’t think I could ever do so in such a way, when I come right down to it.  But you know.  Some people are made for it.  You’re not the only one!   I even think hubby is one himself.”\\r\\n“Who?” said Maggie.\\r\\n“Who do you think?”\\r\\n“Jack?  Mmm, I guess.  I think Jack grew out of that phase a long time ago.  Not to say he doesn’t love me.  We really don’t say it.  Well, not everyday.  At the right times and stuff.  He always manages to tell me one way or another.  Or shows me somehow.”\\r\\n“I thought he adores you, this man,” Paul said.  \\r\\n“I don’t understand,” she replied. \\r\\n“Ah – I’ll let it go.  I’d rather not talk about it on such an important night of yours.  It’s just odd to me.  That’s all.”\\r\\n“Oh,” said Maggie, emphatic and defensive.\\r\\n“I’m not a jerk or anything.  I don’t know.  Maybe I am.  I just have my own thoughts and – in my silly little way – I try to express them.  The best I can, anyways.”\\r\\nHe leaned in towards her, as if to reach out at the smoldered ash of a dead campfire, feeling for heat where it once had been but no longer is: smokeless, dark, and without warmth.  \\r\\n“Look,” said Maggie.  “It’s time I finally thanked the –.”\\r\\nPaul said, “It isn’t that I can’t appreciate how one person feels when they decide to get hitched – or whatever – and plan to spend the rest of their lives together, have children, buy a minivan and all.  I mean, I can understand.  He makes you feel that.  I guess I’m just not built that way.  It always has had to be different with me.  Before, you know.  I mean, love and all.”\\r\\nMaggie had listened with restraint and, she believed, with politeness, but the persistence with which he handled the subject in the manner that he did wore her patience away.\\r\\n“Look, I really must get inside.  I have to greet my guests who must think I’m incredibly rude by this point.  Goodness, I should have been in there before the band began playing again.  So I think I’ll go inside and be a good hostess.”\\r\\n“Of course,” Paul said.  He relented.  “Go ahead.”\\r\\n“Are you coming?”\\r\\n“In a minute, Mrs. Etheridge. Go ahead.”\\r\\n“Ok.  See you in there,” Maggie said.\\r\\n“Alright, and…” he paused, “congratulations.”\\r\\nShe smiled back.  He pretended to return it.\\r\\nPaul watched her disappear through the glass door then slowly turned to lean on the railing.  It saddened him, he thought, that she was no different from any other American girl her age and he felt disappointed in her for behaving the only way she was expected to, for sticking to the script that the world had written for her.  Cradling his empty glass in his hand, he gave it a single shake, and listened to the remaining ice cubes rattle together.  He took out another cigarette and placed it between his lips.  \\r\\nInside, the music subsided.  Someone at the microphone asked the guests to welcome Mr. and Mrs. Jack Ethridge.  Everyone clapped as the couple made their way to the empty dance floor.  The cheers roared-up before bottoming out and male singer began a ballad to which the couple danced.  All the guests watched in amorous admiration.  Several whistles cut though the song and the room filled with the flashing of cameras.\\r\\nWhen Paul finished his cigarette, he went inside.  He walked quickly through the crowd entranced by the dance floor spectacle, directly to the wet bar where the bartender had taken advantage of an opportune break to tidy up his station and replenish his stock.  Paul remained there for almost twenty minutes, listening to the band.   \\r\\nSoon, when it came time for the newly weds to leave, the entire party congregated outside the front entrance of the clubhouse where a horse and buggy was parked, waiting to take the couple away.  Paul followed the crowd outside, looking on from the periphery.  He sat down on a wooden bench behind the cluster of people.  No one had taken it.  He watched the couple gather at the mouth of the door.  The crowd applauded and gave their final regards.  Paul saw what he could from his position in brief glimpses through the gaps of people bunched together, throwing confetti and waving streamers.  The couple mounted the carriage and embarked, waving gratefully to their cheerful onlookers.  When the buggy pulled away, a few guests waited on the curb to watch the couple as they rode away.  \\r\\nPaul remained seated and listened to the sound of the horse’s shoed-hooves click across the pavement.  The sound grew softer as it moved away in the autumn evening, off into a hazy purple sunset.  The music was gone.

Here they rose with the Sun and slept with its setting, under low eaves, on rows of futons head to toe, occasionally visited by field mice.  They took tea, chanted mantras, shared the daily tasks with few words and drank from cold springs of water and wisdom.  Clarity filled the air.  Bai thought that if any place could do her good, this would.  But after many days her heart was still heavy and her belly light.  \\r\\nThe elderly priest, Hui noticed her absence from the morning meditation and crept from the hall silently to seek her.  His deep saffron robes caught the rising Sun and turned his skin to alabaster white.  Bai was sitting by the old well in the new courtyard.  The young woman looked at him upward through down-cast eyes, pearled with tears.  Ancient he seemed to her.  What did he know of modern life?  Hui read the thought in her face.  \\r\\n“I am older than the trees that encircle this courtyard,” he said, “But not as old as the stones that make up its walls.  These walls can give you shelter and there is food a-plenty, company if you wish it, or silence if you don’t.  Here everything is as you require it, yet you are troubled.”  \\r\\nBai dried her eyes and nodded.  “Yes, Master.”\\r\\nWith one hand beneath her chin, he raised her head.  “You see the clouds?  These are the clouds of today.  They do not ask whether one droplet that makes them up, is more important than the rest.  They are all one of many.  They fall as rain.  The trees appreciate every one.  Whether the drop feeds the tree, quenches the thirst or fills the puddle, it does not think its fate inferior or its task unworthy.  It does not ask why.  It is just one of many.  You are young.  You are just beginning to know this.”  \\r\\n“But what about my child?” sobbed the girl.  “My child is dead.”  She grabbed at her belly and rocked back and forth.\\r\\n“Inside you, Bai is the key to unlock the universe.  Everything is as it is.  Regret nothing.  One among many lodges and takes root.  One among many penetrates and develops.  One among many reaches maturity - one among many, not all.

My heart pounded in perfect symmetry with each step coming closer and closer to my room.  The last few steps stomping down the stairs where like an eternity, time became still, my thoughts became numb, and everything was in slow motion.  As my mother turned the door knob to my room, I slowly glanced at the clock in a dreamy like state.  It was 3:34a.m., which could only mean one thing; the day had come that my father lost his 9 month battle with cancer.  Although this was the last and worst memory of him, it is definitely not the only one.  \\r\\nThe song above is one that my father and I used to sing together.  We would go to my aunt''s house once a week.  In her basement was a karaoke machine equipped with thousands of songs to sing to our heart''s content.  However, I always chose the same one. I would grab two microphones, which prompted my father to get up and get ready to sing with his little girl.  I handed him his microphone and he picked me up and sat me on the folding table so we could be eye to eye.   I did the melody; he did the harmony. We would stay there, in that cold empty basement for hours, just taking turns singing song after song, but no song held a candle to the one that my daddy and me sang together.\\r\\nMy father was a stay at home dad.  He did all the cooking and cleaning.  I liked helping with cleaning; not so much the cooking.  He was such a perfectionist so he would always end up re-doing everything that I did but I never got in trouble for it because I was doing my best.  I remember him throwing all of the couch cushions on the freshly vacuumed floor.  I walked into the living room and wondered what had happened.  Were we getting new cushions?  \"You''re standing in hot lava!\" he said.\\r\\n\"The cushions are the only thing you can stand on to save yourself, BUT you can''t stand on one for more then a few seconds or it will sink!\"\\r\\nI started running and jumping on all the cushions and my sister soon joined, I mean, after all they were our only saving grace from the lava!  \\r\\n\"Daddy you are in the lava!\" we would say. \\r\\n\"I am safe because I have my special lava proof socks on,\" he replied. \\r\\nThis was an exciting game we played and a game is all I thought it was.  Later I found out he did this as a way for us to help him fluff the cushions to the couch. Needless to say, it worked!\\r\\nAnother great memory I have of my father was in June of 2000; my high school graduation.  He was so sick with his chemo treatments and radiation. He wasn''t sure if he would be able to make it or.  The ceremony was over and I went up to the stands where all my friends and family where; and my father wasn''t.  I was sad.  Not because he wasn''t there, but because of how sick he was and how he was just falling apart. After a few minutes of mingling we started to walk up the stands to leave.  Then I looked to my right, and there came my daddy being escorted by his mother, my grandmother.  He did make it and although he didn''t look like himself, he looked better to me then ever.  I ran up to him and threw my arms around his neck so happy to see him.  He said he wouldn''t have missed it for the world.\\r\\nMy father passed away on February 8th, 2001.  It doesn''t matter how much time passes by, the pain does ease, but I always miss him.  It''s hard not to want to call him for advice on decorating my house, or to ask him a cooking question and my wedding day was even harder.  The only thing that comforts me is the memories we did get to share together.  Those will keep me going forever since he can no longer be here to watch me grow or see the changes in my life.\r\n', 'Let Me Be There By Amber Wey', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'let-me-be-there-by-amber-wey', '', '', '2020-05-17 22:54:24', '2020-05-18 06:54:24', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=77', 0, 'post', '', 3),

I found them in the bath tub, legs given way under the weight of their bodies. I moved to turn the tap on, rid myself of this nightmare, but as my hand touched the metal a spasm of pain shot through my arm. They seemed to disintegrate in front of me, a child’s scribble done in reverse as layer after layer of the messy black lines were removed.\\r\\nMy eyes flickered open to the alarm clock shining 04:48 in angular red numerals. I moved quietly across the hallway and touched open the door to Robbie’s room. Emily – my sister, younger by five years – was asleep on the sofa under an old duvet with the door half open and I stepped lightly to avoid disturbing her.\\r\\nI sat on his bed. It was stripped, bare, the mattress stained in one corner. I remembered how, as the illness had taken hold, he would wake up terrified of the spiders that, he said, streamed into the house through every gap; under the doors, through the vent in the bathroom. I would check, gently sooth him. Sometimes there was one there, a single creature looking – at least I imagined – rather bewildered by all the commotion. Robbie would scream and cry as I would coax it gently onto an electricity bill and shake it onto the path below.\\r\\nAs things got worse, he spent more and more nights at the hospital. Most times I stayed, getting what little sleep I could in a fold up bed beside him. Others – like tonight – I let his father stay with him while I headed home for the sleep I knew would never eventuate.\\r\\nI sat there in Robbie’s room for more than half an hour before the loud ringing of the phone destroyed the silence. My son died that autumn night, with the branches brushing against the windows and the creaking call of a tui sounding in the background.

(76, 1, '2020-05-16 22:30:07', '2020-05-17 06:30:07', 'What I always forget about long naps is that when I wake up, I feel disoriented, heavy, impatient, groggy, mean, and sick.  I yawn, stretch my arms into a Village People “Y,” and I feel tired, except I just slept three hours.  When I’m like that, the photo of me on the T.V. stand, the one where I’m wearing the oversized Florida sweatshirt, makes me look like an elephant.  Or I hang up the phone on Jay because he’s singing into the receiver.  I am impatient and heavy and groggy, mean, sick.  \\r\\nToday, I hate that I napped at all like I hate having taken that photograph of me swallowed up in faded blue and orange cotton.  I should have been wide awake and energized because then I could have more quickly reached for the injured arm my next-door neighbor thrust forward when I answered the door. I could have been more gracious when he asked for peroxide and a band-aid.  Instead, I cut my eyes, glaring at him before going into the bathroom to get the supplies.\\r\\n“Can you do it for me?” he asks, and steps forward, holds the door open with his good arm.  “I’m not crazy or nothing.  I swear it.”\\r\\n“Come on,” I sigh, wave him through the front door and to the bathroom, to the sink.  “Put it here.”\\r\\n I’m just too clumsy,” he apologizes and scratches his forehead at the same time that lukewarm water (I assume because I don’t reach my fingers in to feel) hits his bloody arm, running off in a pink stream down the drain.  It’s an icky sideways cut with puss around the edges almost the same color as the bubbling peroxide, and coarse black hairs on the unaffected skin surround the wound like soldiers, except now his arm is wet.  So the hairs look more like sleeping soldiers.\\r\\nEither because I stare too much or he feels ashamed, he says “I hit it against the wall.”  The bruise looks at least a couple days old, sticky and red, now oozing puss and peroxide.  I turn the water off and cover the bruise in gauze and an ace bandage, but he doesn’t turn to leave.\\r\\nHe wants more?  A band-aid?  More peroxide? …Neosporin?  I am impatient, mean, groggy, and sick.\\r\\n “You a real nice lady,” he says and twists his bandaged arm, sort of like a wet dog does its fur.  “I knew you would help me.”  \\r\\nI say to myself Just Go. Just Go. Just Go.\\r\\nHe stands there slowly turning his head to take stock of the bathroom in all its lavender and sage decorations.  I feel like a watery pot of grits ready to splatter my annoyance full force onto this neighbor.  I clamp my hands down on the sink and breathe real hard out loud and blame even this degree of rudeness on the nap. It’s the nap.  \\r\\nI leave the bathroom and look behind me in the hallway; there he is grabbing that black-haired arm as if it were broken, not merely bruised.  I stop at the front door.  He stops in the living room, past the front door.  I wrap my hand around the knob.  \\r\\nGo. Go. Go.\\r\\nWhat else does he want, what in the living room has caught his attention, and if I give it to him, will he finally leave, or see it as an invitation to stay longer or an extension of friendship and come back.  But he doesn’t want anything in the living room I discover when he turns to me and says real gentle-like, “Black fella live here just before you,” because he wants to prolong his stay, and he lets go of his arm and turns his head upward, so I can only see the whites of his eyes because he’s so much taller than me.  Then he looks back down so that now I can see the blue irises and his eyes are wet, like he’s about to cry. I take my hand off the door knob.\\r\\n‘Yep,” he continues and draws out the word, preparing to say more, which he does.  “Nicest man you ever want to meet.  We was good friends.  Lost touch, though.  Last time I seen him was at the Food Lion two, three years ago.”\\r\\n “Quite compelling, but –“\\r\\n “Think you can give me one more round of that Peroxide?”  He wipes his eyes and takes a step toward the bathroom.\\r\\n At that moment is when I feel most the effect of the nap.  All the bad stuff  – disoriented, slightly heavy, impatient, groggy, mean and sick – tears straight through my chest and down my arms into a hand that yanks the front door open so fast it bends the slinky doorstopper and rams into the wall with a force that makes my neighbor stop and stare, all wet-eyed and trembling.\\r\\nI let it all out in a steady stream of harsh air.  I wish he would go.  I’m not myself and I slept too long today and now I’m leaning against the door as if I’m too heavy for my legs.  I put my hands on my knees and bend over and mumble between deep breaths “Just go.  Just go. Just go.”  He does but first puts his hand on the small of my back, leaning over my hunched body to whisper his apologies.  I close the door and lie down on the couch, but my body won’t relax.  My ears pulse in the same angry beat as my heart, and my back burns.\\r\\nI should go and apologize.  I know this, except the part of me that feels heavy won’t let me up off the couch and the mean part doesn’t care.  Today, I napped too long.  I’m disoriented, slightly heavy, impatient, groggy, mean, and sick.  I wish I were wide awake – so I could feel refreshed and light like a dust ball or dandelion seeds that float on the air like summer snow.\\r\\n<em>Cassander L.

What he remembered was the place she told him she came from. “I’m from a wonderful town called Sewickley.” She pronounced it carefully and distinctly, as if he were a slow second-grader. Perhaps if she’d said “My name is Suuusan,” he would have remembered her name, but the town was what stuck. “It’s near Pittsburgh. It may sound like it has a funny name, but it’s a wonderful town. A wonderful town.” It was like a little lecture. \\r\\nWhat was so special about Sewickley? She wasn’t explaining. Lots of trees, he guessed, lots of single-family homes, good schools. The sort of place everyone came from. Up to then, he’d spent his life moving with his family from one such place to another, and one or two classmates he’d known in the different schools from each of those towns seemed to have wound up just down the hall in his dormitory.\\r\\nHe caught himself as he realized his mind was wandering, and she saw it. She broke off the little lecture. Maybe he’d been in the running, maybe not, but now he was certainly dinged for not paying attention. The way to get into a good university is to pay attention, or seem to. There’s extra credit if you make the right remarks. Whatever the test was here, he’d failed it.\\r\\nWhy, he wondered in later years, did he keep coming back to that little encounter, and why did it make him feel so acutely that he hadn’t made the grade? She’d thought that whole talk through, he gradually came to understand. Likely she rehearsed it. Maybe this was the fiftieth time she’d done the whole routine. It was her version of the admissions process; she was working her way through an applicant pool. She was looking for the one guy who’d pay attention to her little lecture all the way through, or at least seem to..\\r\\nAlmost certainly, he reflected, she found him.\\r\\n<em>John''s writing has appeared, or will appear, in Byline Magazine.

I speak of my father, broad in shoulder, short in stature, whose lips, when smiling, cracked wide open like a brown nut in autumn.\r\n \r\nAnd, as I reminisce, my companions nod their heads as if my language is their own and I promise that, when I pass through this lonely mortal life, I will soar like a bird over seas and countries until I reach my beloved homeland.', 'Silent Companions by Jennifer Walmsley', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'silent-companions-by-jennifer-walmsley', '', '', '2020-05-21 23:52:08', '2020-05-22 07:52:08', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=82', 0, 'post', '', 7),

I was always sticky and grubby – I spent most of my time outdoors playing with my new friend. We went to the park, played in my back garden, and roamed the local vacant land – a very mysterious and lonely place when you’re nine years old. \\r\\nThe little plot was quiet and still – like a forgotten, empty writing book left over from school. It was close to home – I could see the roof of my house – and yet it was so different. There was a wild tangle all over it’s surface – a strange mix of fast growing weeds and the more familiar garden plants my mother grew at home. It felt like another country – but just around the corner from home; very handy when you wanted to play pretend.\\r\\nThat day we were intrepid explorers, bent on a secret mission to save – something or someone or other. We were very important anyway. It was vital that we succeeded; everything hung in the balance. I had \"borrowed\" my mother’s carving knife and had it stuck into the waistband of my shorts – like a real explorer I told my friend. I used it to hack at the jungle undergrowth we were slowly making our way through – the native machete wielding bearers had disappeared because of the multitude of ferocious wild animals we were always encountering.\\r\\nThat expedition had been very unlucky – we’d lost a couple of the natives right at the start to a huge pack of lions and tigers (Like I said, I was nine – and very shaky on geography) and then the marauding bands of wild tribesmen had polished off a good number more – but we had fought valiantly and hard – heroes both. And we’d saved the rest of the bearers from hideous certain death (having their heads shrunk on their necks, and then being boiled alive for the tribesmen’s lunch. I didn’t have much sense of a time line too at that age).\\r\\nAs the sun lowered in the sky, and the evening crept up on us, I wiped my eyes clear of sweat and turned to my trusty companion:\\r\\n“How about we come back and finish this after tea? My Mum’s called us twice, and I know she’s got some ice-lollies in the freezer-box for afters”\\r\\n“What flavour?” asked my gallant sidekick.\\r\\n“Raspberry Ripples”\\r\\n“’k then – race ya?”\\r\\n<em><a href=\"http://www.writewords.org.uk/Hickman-Gibb/\">Avis Hickman-Gibb</a> is a newly established writer, living in rural Suffolk, England with her husband, one son and two cats.

We, and about eighty other parents, met the principal, the school psychologist, all five kindergarten teachers, the administrative director, two first grade teachers, the librarian, the art teacher, the physical education teacher, the night custodian, the director of the PTA, the PTA fund-raising coordinator, the director of bi-lingual education, the director of transportation, the speech pathologist, the director of the PTA communications office, four teacher''s aides and someone else. Almost all of the teachers were endowed with a charming, youthful silhouette. None looked like they could deliver the thunderous reprimands of the Sister Christopher of my youth. The night custodian, a charming woman about my age, fifty-x, looked as if she could have snapped my neck in the wink of an eye.\\r\\nWe learned there will be about ninety new kindergartners and five different kindergarten classes in the school. Two of the classes will be bi-lingual.\\r\\nAll of this took place at ''Neath Lake Elementary School. This is the same place that my dad, Jilly''s grandfather went to school from 1924 - 1935 (first grade through high school).\r\nBy the end of the meeting, three things occurred to me:\\r\\n1. In order to assure a heterogeneous (a word which should only be written with a space between each letter thusly -- h e t e r o g e n e o u s) I''ll start again. In order to assure a h e t e r o g e n e o u s student population in kindergarten, as mandated by New York State law, all new kindergarten students must be screened by school officials prior to admission. I guess this applies to schools that will have multiple incoming classes as well as to provide some Department of Education number cruncher some raw data in order to prove something to someone. The children, we learned would be tested in six categories: Large Motor Skills; Cognitive Skills; Language Skills; Shape Shifting; and Cookie Eating. We were assured any number of times that this was not a test and that our children could not fail. We were told that the results of this non-testing could not, would not, should not be shared with the child''s parents. That the information would only be used to assure a h e t e r o g e n e o u s classroom population.\\r\\nI have always known, and confirmed last night, that I am, for the most part, a very accepting and trusting individual. This can be evidenced by the fact that after we were informed of the fail-safe screening, I had no questions for the school officials. I did not even ask if someone should have spell checked the principal''s presentation. Oh, h e t e r o g e n e o u s was spelled well enough but I am still wondering what I should tell them Jilly''s \"heigth\" is. My other co-parents though are not quite as trusting and what occurred to me, after about the two-hundred-seventy-sixth question about kindergarten screening from only about six of the other seventy-nine parents in the room, was that there was another kind of screening taking place right in front of my eyes and it was this: These teachers, in order to survive the school year are going to have to ASSURE that these six parents have their children in separate classrooms. Otherwise, the lovely and patient Mrs. Greenhild will probably go postal (or hombre postaleros if they end up in her bi-lingual education program).\\r\\n2. Everyone at my job is \"Bill,\" \"Bob,\" \"Ruth,\" \"Sarah,\" \"Lester,\" \"Asshole Trevor,\" or \"etc.\" What I mean is everyone is on a \"first name\" or \"epithet and first name basis.\" At school, it turns out that everyone is: Mrs. Greenhild, Mr. Ingram, Mrs. Lipton-Soupmix. I cannot handle this. I have to get on a first name basis with these people in a hurry or I''ll be as afraid to address them as I am to order a double-mocha-cino-mora-java-llada-roma at Starbucks. It''s intimidating. I just want to be able to say to Jilly''s teacher, \"So, Julie are we having fun learning?\" or \"Jules, are we up to speed on the shape shifting thing yet?\" (I do plan to refer to Jilly as \"we\" in school as I am prepared to take 100% responsibility for everything related to \"our\" schooling because there is no way she is getting away with the stuff that I got away with.) So, I am pretty sure the road to this kind of relationship with the staff at Jilly''s school is paved with money. Money that flows to the school in new ways. New Money. Money for a class trip to a herbologist. Maybe a new laptop for the Department of Education number cruncher. I have to get involved. I have to volunteer. I have to attend meetings. I have to vote in the school board election. I have to, well, to use the ''f'' word. I have to fund-raise. So this constitutes fair warning. Be prepared to buy, from me, at a significant mark-up: wrapping paper, books, chocolate, costume jewelry, magazine subscriptions, doilies. Save your money. You name it. We''re selling it. You''re buying it.\\r\\n3. I cried as we were leaving the school. My father walked these halls eighty years ago. He had his whole life ahead of him and he decided to have children instead. I am eternally grateful. Last night, all of the teachers, administrators, therapists talked about the children, our children, my child as if they really liked children. As if they liked my child. Already. Not ever having met her. They were articulate about what the children do each day at school. They knew when school started. They knew when school ended. They were teaching over the summer. And they were attending a meeting at 7:30 in the evening with seventy-four reasonable and six treacherously aggressive parents. Do you know how many people who work at my office would attend a 7:30PM meeting? Well, other than Asshole Trevor, no one would.\\r\\n\r\nSo, we''ve made first contact with our child''s educators.

Recently his work has appeared (or is forthcoming) in The Iconoclast, The American Dissident, Freefall, Ship of Fools, True Romance Magazine, The Laureate, and Spillway.</em>\r\n', 'The Man-Playing Guitar and the Guitar-Playing Man by Simon Thalmann', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '86-revision-3', '', '', '2008-07-28 15:08:51', '2008-07-28 23:08:51', '', 86, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/86-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(91, 1, '2020-05-25 00:28:01', '2020-05-25 08:28:01', 'A few years ago, when I taught English Composition at a community college, one of the first essays I’d assign students was “The Transaction” by William Zinsser. In the essay, Zinsser writes about a doctor who has recently begun to write and has experienced some publishing successes. He compares his way of working with the way the doctor works. Zinsser points out that to him, a professional writer, writing is a vocation, while to the doctor, it is an avocation. The assignment of the term “avocation” implies the doctor will never be taken seriously as a writer. At least that’s the impression I always came away with each time I re-read the essay in preparation for discussing it with a new group of students.\n\nI always wanted to call writing my vocation. Like many people, I had a lifelong dream of being a writer. I returned to school as an adult, when my youngest child was in first grade, to pursue that dream. I’d read and taken to heart the words of another professional writer, John Gardner, that anyone serious about becoming a writer should first get a liberal arts education. After earning my Bachelor’s degree, I went on for my MFA in fiction writing. Creative writing programs are ideal in granting students the time to write amid an atmosphere of creativity. You “fill the well” with ideas and learn the craft by reading and discussing each others’ stories, as well as classic and contemporary works of literary value. And if that doesn’t keep you writing, there’s the additional pressure of having to produce a book-length work for your final thesis in order to graduate. I walked away with my degree along with a few awards and visions of writing grandeur. \n<!--more-->\nBut after seven years in school, supported emotionally and financially by an encouraging husband, I felt a need to justify all that time spent earning my undergrad and graduate degrees. So I began to teach. I never viewed teaching as my vocation. First and foremost, I was a writer. The teaching was just something I did—a class or two a semester—on the side.\n\nOnly “on the side” took up a huge portion of what I’d anticipated would be my writing time. I am conscientious and hard working by nature, and approach everything I take on with gusto. Teaching was no different. I was dedicated to helping my students discover and develop their individual voices. I wanted them to love writing the way I loved it, to recognize the strength and power of the English language. I spent hours at home reading, thinking about, and marking up their assignments, not only grammatically, but in an attempt to push them to dig deeper into their individual stories. I gave their work the same time and attention and respect that I would any fellow writer’s. \n\nI found teaching rewarding. To clarify, I found being in the classroom rewarding, but the politics of academia not worth the budgeted dollars they were paying me. One semester I ended up teaching 11 credits, one credit shy of a full-time load, miserable that I had no time to work on my own stories. I decided to take a break the following spring to put into practice the subject I’d been teaching and pursue my vocation. I was going to write.\n\nWhat happened that spring is as unsurprising as a predictable plotline. With time stretched out endlessly before me, I filled it just as endlessly with writing-related activities, all of which provided a pretext of writing but produced little new work. I surfed the Internet in pursuit of suitable publications. I wrote cover letters and submitted to those publications, garnering my market share of rejection slips. I joined an online critique group and spent more time reading other people’s stories than writing my own. I signed up for a number of online writing discussion lists and used up hours responding to the posts which poured into my e-mail. My fingers were striking the keyboard, but I wasn’t writing.\n\nI wasn’t the complete slug, or as my students would label it, slacker, that I’m making myself out to be. I did write a few essays, a form I became interested in while teaching, and placed them, along with some older stories, in decent publications. I became involved in fighting an attempt at censorship in the public schools in my county. This led to a bit of national exposure for my work; I was invited to write a guest column for The Washington Post. Although I was writing passionately about something I cared deeply about, I’d lost my creative focus and along with it, the ability to enter my imagination to produce fiction, the literary art I’d studied for years. \n\nI am an impulsive person and impulsively one day, five months into my vocation as a full-time writer, I picked up the newspaper, studied the want ads and started to send out my resume. I quickly progressed from applying for part-time to applying for full-time positions, reasoning in my non-writing angst that as long as I was going to compromise on my dream and work for someone else, I might as well be well paid for my efforts. \n\nWhen I began my new position as a contract administrator for a real estate broker, I didn’t know what to expect. I’d had various jobs since birthing my first child, but I hadn’t worked full-time in twenty-two years. I took the job more out of self-disgust and frustration than a desire for self-growth and fulfillment. \n\nSo what did I discover? After years of teaching freshman English Composition, a class the majority of students don’t want to take, mothering children who once they are teenagers don’t want to be mothered, and writing stories so many editors don’t want to publish, it was a refreshing change to work hard and have not only my boss, but all his clients tell me what a great job I was doing. I grew to love the real estate business. My communication skills, both oral and written, and the requirements of the job were a perfect match. I’d found my vocation.\n\nMaybe the ending is to be expected, a plot twist in what continues to be a predictable storyline. I still write. Now that writing has become my avocation, I have become more prolific despite, or maybe because of, having to squeeze my writing into narrow periods of time. \n\n\n<em><a href=\"http://www.peggyduffy.com\">Peggy Duffy''s</a> short stories and essays have appeared in numerous publications, including The Washington Post, Newsweek, Notre Dame Magazine, Smokelong Quarterly, Octavo, Three Candles, So To Speak, Literary Mama, Main Street Rag, and Brevity, as well as various Cup of Comfort anthologies.

The N333 is sat in the bay as he approaches, indicators flashing and doors closing as it goes to pull away. Rory hammers with the side of his fist on the damp red flank of the bus and, luckily, the driver pauses to let him on.\\r\\nIt is the older style of bus; the fabric on the seats is orange, shot through with geometrical shapes in a mustard yellow. The paint on the hold bar flecks off in his palm as he grabs the pole to steady himself as the bus jerks into the stream of traffic.  They always bring out the old fleet of buses for this nothing period of the night, where the only people likely to be traveling are too drunk or too tired to care about the damp smell and abrasive seating.\\r\\nRory swings off the hold bar into a seat towards the back, where he can feel the rumbling of the left rear wheel under his feet.

He cannot see her face, but her hair is straight and blonde, her figure trim in a short black jacket and jeans. Her fingers are long and thin, pianist fingers, with chipped pale pink nail varnish. She tosses her damp hair over her shoulder as she swings her bag into a seat, and slides in after it.\\r\\nThree rows ahead of him, she is hyper-real, each strand of hair haloed as the fluorescent tube bulb overhead picks up the droplets of rain clinging there. She fidgets - can she sense his eyes upon her? – and pulls her phone from her bag. The screen lights up as she flips the phone open and closed. No messages. She tosses her phone back into her bag and turns to face the window.\\r\\nHer face thrown back by the dark window is what Rory expected; she is pale and strong featured. The rain on the outside of the glass gouges across the reflection of her face in streaks as the bus hits a straight road and moves up a gear. The two sit in silence as the bus trundles on through sleeping London. If she does sense his attention, she makes no sign of it.\\r\\nThe bus slows once more, but passes the next stop without pausing when the driver sees no passengers waiting there. The blonde girl pulls her phone from her bag again, distractedly. No messages. Who was she expecting a text from at this time of night, Rory wonders.\\r\\nAnother stop, this time to let off a passenger who had been sitting on the upstairs deck. The drunken woman lurches off into the night, and the driver hesitates at his wheel as he peers into the darkness after her, willing her home safely. The blonde girl shifts restlessly in her seat; she is eager to get home herself and there are only a few stops left to travel.\\r\\nSlowly, slowly, the bus pulls away onto the road again. It is the darkest point of the night; moon and stars have set, but there is yet to be even the slightest chink of light in the eastern sky. The streetlights cast the world as orange and dull, reflecting hazily off of the wet humps of parked cars. The bus headlights shine straight, illuminating the rear of the night bus ahead.\\r\\nThe penultimate stop; the driver slows and carries on past when he sees that it too is empty. Rory knows that time is short now, minutes only. But he does nothing but watch the blonde girl as she checks her phone for a third time, and, once again, is disappointed. She places it back into her bag and zips it up.\\r\\nPreparing for the short walk ahead of her, the girl pulls her hair back and rotates her shoulders as she inches towards the edge of her seat. A quick dash through the rain and she would be home; it had been a long day. Rory too, is preparing himself for leaving the close shelter of the bus, for braving the dark and the rain awaiting outside.\\r\\nThis bus terminates here. The blonde girl stands before the bus comes to a stop, clutching the pole by the exit doors as she adjusts the weight of her handbag on her shoulder. The doors slide open with a hiss and the blonde girl hops down. He hears the loose tarmac of the bus bay crunch under her feet as she lands somewhere in the darkness beyond the doors.\\r\\nHe is mere seconds behind her, but he knows now that however quickly he follows her, she is always gone by the time he reaches the doors. He is left with nothing but the shadows in the bus station. Behind him the bus gives a shudder and the lights die. The driver, shift half over, hops down from the front entrance. Giving Rory a perfunctory nod, collar up against the rain, he stalks off in search of a warm drink in a polystyrene cup to see him through till dawn.\\r\\nRory’s feet are aching again. He turns down a cobbled mews road, the shortcut home, out of habit more than anything. It only saves about three minutes. He stops suddenly; the streetlights refracting over the tops of the buildings are playing tricks on him, conjuring up the light of a pale face, of blonde hair tossed over a shoulder. She stalks ahead of him, leading the way home; surely it is just the pattering of the rain that is drowning out her heels clicking against the cobbles?\\r\\nFor the sake of three minutes; for the sake of an empty purse – Emma never trusted herself with cash; for the sake of a few extra hours sleep on his part, she was left like a rag doll there in these narrow mews, the blood soaked deep into the darkness of her jacket but oh so red against the paleness of her skin, of her hair, of the suede bag she clutched so fiercely to her chest, even in death.\\r\\nRory walks on, following the lights. He always picked her up from the bus station after she finished a night shift, but that night he had been irritable, tired. He’d needed the sleep.

He’d said that his mother was convinced that he could charm the birds out of the trees. She knew this was just a silly expression. And yet . . .Perhaps his mother had recognized something in him that no one else had.\\r\\nHer three-year old daughter had been tired all day and now lay sleeping on the sofa with her new Barbie backpack clutched tightly in her hand. On the day she received it, he had taken a photograph of her wearing it, almost as large as she was. Her first backpack.They had laughed at the image of her attending her first day of school not too many years from now with the pack strapped to her back.\r\nAs she watched the small form in its slumber, she drew up her legs tighter, took another sip of wine and for the first time in almost a month, closed her eyes and allowed her mind to drift as the warm blanket of alcohol began to comfort her.\\r\\nThe birds. It was such a small and seemingly silly thing he had begun. Perhaps because there was no longer anything left in his life, or perhaps he saw them as the only living thing he could relate to. Whatever his reasons, he fed the birds every morning and they became known as Daddy’s Birds. There was no proper bird feeder on the deck, just an upturned piece of plastic upon which he poured the birdseed mixture, albeit sufficient to feed every bird for miles around. And they would come. Every day. In many different varieties. There were Blue Tits, Mouse birds, Bee Eaters, Northern cardinals, house sparrows and many others she did not even recognize. But among these twittering, flittering bursts of color and song, his favorite had been a simple common dove that, for reasons of its own, had taken to sitting on a branch of a nearby peach tree to wait for him. He would amble onto the deck when he awoke from yet another night of pain and terror on the couch and fill the plastic tray with seeds. The small dove that he maintained was a female would perk up, its head bobbing and its tail wagging when it heard the seeds being dispensed. As soon as he closed the patio door, the dove would glide down, peck at the morning’s offering, looking up every now and then and bob its head as if in gratitude.\\r\\nOnce the birds were eating, he could often open the patio door without too many of the birds fleeing. The dove, although a bit skittish, would not fly away unless it was approached. He would stand and make small cooing sounds, which the bird appeared to enjoy as it pecked at the seed, apparently aware that it was in no immediate danger. And the whistling. He would stand at the patio door for a while, before his legs went numb and he had to hobble back to the sofa, and whistle between his teeth, trying to mimic the sounds the birds made.They responded to this strange man-made sound and would often chirp back at him. The dove’s head would bob back and forth more vigorously and its tail would flash up and down like a metronome. She wondered what he was saying to them and if they somehow understood. He’d been doing this for months and she had taken to buying special packs of wild birdseed so he always had a fresh supply. The dove particularly like sunflower seeds while the others would eventually pick up every scrap of millet. If he were late on some mornings, depending on his pain level or degree of panic, he was greeted by a chorus of wild birds, lined up along the top of the deck as if waiting for their breakfast. They’d flutter away when he went out with the cup of seed but would return as soon as he went indoors again and he’d watch them from the door, careful not to move the curtain and startle them away.\\r\\nThe last morning was like any other and she had been preceded down the stairs as usual by their daughter, Kinsley, shouting, “Good morning, daddy!'' - the latest addition to her rapidly expanding vocabulary. The night before had been particularly hard. He’d had a massive pain attack and had lain on the floor, his face white with terror and his eyes a rheumy yellow green color as the pain gripped tighter in his spine and chest, threatening to squeeze the life out of him like a sponge. She wasn’t sure what he thought at times like this, but when she looked into his eyes she often felt, and hoped, that he drifted away to some imaginary place where the pain could not reach him. But she knew it was not really that way and that she was only consoling herself. He had not slept in their bed for almost two years. It was too painful. Instead, he stretched out on a long leather sofa in the lounge downstairs, tossing and turning until he found a position that would allow him to drift into an unfulfilling doze. He never really slept properly. It was more of a respite from exhaustion and the powerful narcotics he took.\\r\\nShe had watched him fading away for almost three years. Watched as the pain attacks became more frequent, more vicious and more personal. Pain had relentlessly drained the life from him, dulled his eyes and stolen his personality and character; leaving behind a scared, withered shell of a man. The pain medication did work, but not enough to offer any real relief, ‘painkiller’ being a misnomer. He lived with the shackles of pain constantly.  He’d recently been prescribed a very powerful narcotic but was too scared to take it. Several deaths had been ascribed to some of its irreversible side effects, notably that of respiratory failure. It was a drug intended for terminal cancer patients to control their breakthrough pain. Patients who received round-the-clock morphine. Patients who no longer cared about the adverse effects of pain medication and who would welcome the oblivion such a drug might inadvertently bring them.\\r\\nThe look on Kinsley’s face that morning was etched into her mind. She was standing beside her father with her hand on his arm and for the very first time, he had not acknowledged her enthusiastic morning greeting. The air in the room was heavy and stale and she had known without looking that there would be no greeting. His hands had been a pale blue color and as she had slowly walked over to him, her heart filled with dread. She had felt a certain relief when she saw that his eyes were closed and that if there were any justice in this world, that he had simply gone to sleep. Through searing tears she had said, “Let Daddy sleep a bit more, sweetie. He’s tired. Really tired.” And then she had made the phone call she had known was inevitable and things had moved quickly. Kinsley was taken next door to play with her little friend while arrangements were made at home. Before she left, Kinsley was told to kiss daddy night-night and had remarked, “Brr, daddy’s cold.” And then with great care so as not to awaken him, she had had pulled the blanket up a little more to keep her father warm.\\r\\nThe church service had been short and personal with just one close friend and her sons in attendance. Kinsley had spent the morning asking where daddy was, which had made it almost unbearable. He had insisted on being cremated, because pain would not likely be interested in mere ashes. \\r\\nThe days drifted by and blurred into each other. The well-wishers had tapered off and the house felt bigger than ever, with Kinsley often asking where her daddy was and saying that she missed him, even though she meant that she loved him. But perhaps she really did miss him, too. This had produced the strongest tears and all she could do was say that daddy had gone away to sleep and that they would just have to wait until they could see him again.\\r\\nIt had been a brighter-than-usual morning and it was Kinsley who had first remarked on the noise. Even from within the house, the sound of birds was quite loud, almost demanding attention.\r\nKinsley had pulled aside the curtain and shouted, “Look, Mommy. Birds!”\\r\\nAnd she had known immediately what her daughter was looking at. She had opened the cupboard, taken down the half-filled bag of birdseed and scooped up a full cup of the contents. Taking Kinsley’s hand, she had pulled aside the curtain on the patio and the sight that met her had made her gasp. Hundreds of birds of all sizes and shapes were lined on the top of the deck. There were birds in the jasmine vines, birds in the peach tree and even some on the ground. But among this assemblage, sitting in its usual spot was the small dove watching her intently, its head and tail bobbing. Some of the birds had flittered away when she had walked out onto the deck, but most of them had simply watched her in silence through black, beady eyes as she emptied the cup into the plastic feeder. She had felt as if she somehow offered them an explanation, but was not able to do the bird whistle he had done so well. Besides, what would she whistle to them? She had barely made it back indoors before the birds had descended and they had watched them, Kinsley rapt with fascination as the birds ate the seeds. And then, with a final glance towards the door, they took to the sky in all directions.\\r\\nThe birds never did return, no matter how much seed she put out. A few squirrels dropped by and stole the peanuts that were often included in the feed, but the birds never came back.\\r\\nExcept one. Some days, sitting in the peach tree as if waiting, was the small dove. But it never again ate any of the seed. She had picked up and kept a small gray and white feather that the bird had shed.\\r\\nSometimes, when they were out shopping, a bird would fly by or they’d see one sitting on a fence post. With great delight, Kinsley would shout, “Look, mommy! Daddy’s bird! Is Daddy still sleeping?”\\r\\nThe birds they saw may have been daddy’s birds; she would never know. But they took some solace in the fact that no matter how many birds they saw, they all appeared to be happy and not in any pain at all.\r\n', 'The Last Birdsong by Graham Murray', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-last-birdsong-by-graham-murray', '', '', '2020-05-29 01:45:40', '2020-05-29 09:45:40', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=106', 0, 'post', '', 1),

Just the two of us.  It’s a red car of some make; a 1960-something Vauxhall. I’m ten years old. My father smells of coconut oil. He always smells good—fresh, earthy and natural.

Don’t get sidetracked into thinking you have to be a lawyer or any of that nonsense,” he says.\\r\\nHe’s been on this mission to save my poetic soul.

You’ll never be one of those persons trapped in arid mental categories.” \\r\\nIn the car we’re silent. We’re looking at the floor. He edges closer and puts his arm around me.

I can see my granddad, my mother’s father seething on the front porch. Everyone’s thought of my dad as a real loser, a bum who can’t hold a job. He can give his children a lot of hugs and kisses, and he sings really well to them, but boy, he sure can’t support them financially. That job’s been left to my mother. Yesterday he spontaneously dropped by and said: “J, ask for anything you want. Anything in the whole wide world.”\\r\\n“I want a lemon meringue pie.” \\r\\nTen minutes later he comes by with the biggest pie I’d ever seen. I eat it right there on the spot.\\r\\nWe’re still looking on the floor of the car and I know that he’s going to say something that will make us very sad. He’s just emancipated me from a lifetime of school drudgery (I don’t ever have to do math, I can skip classes and read novels and poetry), and now he’s going to spoil it with bad news. I can sense it. The silence is unbearable. He begins to weep. Silently. He moves in closer. His body is trembling a little bit. I see his right ankle twitching in his Jesus sandal. Beads of sweat are breaking out on his legs, and he’s toying with the pleats in his denim shorts. \\r\\nHe says: “I love you, Jason. I love you so much. I love you more than anything and anyone else.” \\r\\nI feel numb and sad at the same time. I feel lonely and confused. I want to hug him back, but I just sit there looking at my skinny, brown legs. I dare to look up at his face and see something I can’t write about because I can’t understand it.  I see a look of absolute despair. He rests his head against mine and whispers over and over again: “I love you, I love you. I love you.”\\r\\nI look up, wondering where my brother is. My grandfather is walking towards the car. He shouts something inaudible. He wants me back in the house, and suddenly my father bolts from the car and says, still crying: “I need to speak to my son. I have a right to speak to my son.” \\r\\nI’d never seen my father in this state before. I can’t recall the exchange. I only remember the anger of my grandfather and the sobbing desperation in my father’s voice as he defends his right to speak to his son.

And he loved me back.\\r\\nThe day before I had wrapped my legs around his waist and kissed him all over his neck and he told his mother: “I think my son is in love with me.”  \\r\\nHe had lost his battles, tried to take his own life twice. The world told him he was a fool and yet, he had told me that I was to be a writer, and that I was special. \\r\\n He said he’d seen God’s face and was seduced by its beauty. The world said he had caught schizophrenia.\\r\\nNow it was over. This love affair with my father. Just like that. He comes to the house a few months later dressed in a white robe, painted white boots, and a white sword tucked into a sash on his white belt. He wears a white turban over his head that stretches his green eyes into two eerie slits. \\r\\nHe will have to repudiate us, he says. He has been called out to do God’s work, to be his servant and to be the bride of Christ. He explains and explains. Then, what he calls the apocalyptic announcement: “Observe my son, I am now married now to Christ whom I love more than anything else, even you.”\\r\\nHe leaves, and he never looks back as I stand staring out into the distance, perhaps in the same spot where he’d stood a few months earlier asserting his right to speak to and weep with me. \\r\\nI get this in the mail from him a few weeks later.   \\r\\n<em>My Son, Oh my Son.\r\nHow do I regret time was too short to\r\nKiss your sweat while we played. \\r\\nBorn prematurely old\r\nI was called out to war;  Vanity was not my cause  Nor the cause of my Requiem.

Thank you sweet Jesus, thank you God, for delivering my first born back into my arms,” he cries.  \\r\\nI am looking in the rearview mirror of my aunt’s car which I’ve borrowed.

(114, 1, '2008-02-02 16:38:11', '2008-02-03 00:38:11', 'No matter how many times the hygienist interrupts her Rod and Gun Club wedding reception story to adjust the chair lamp, it keeps tilting back and blinding me. The torn utensil package lies caul-like, contorted on the metal tray. The white walls are saturated with the charred smell of old drilling.\\r\\nShe peppers her story with warnings like \"Not flossing when you brush is like not washing your armpits when you shower\" while clamping my tongue down with a nickel-sized mirror and grazing a pick along my gum line in deft arcs. Electric red wires splay from the corners of her eyes. I think she is smiling under that mask.\\r\\nI want to tell her that the orange cheese puffs and the flat root beer and the chocolate snack cakes, that the honeymoon at the Grand Canyon and the sex on the backyard hammock and the long margarita conversations-that none of it lasts; that the gel one day strains into a few elastic strings between you both, which snap into fewer and fewer each time he leaves in the morning to repair another refrigerator or washing machine. But I can only respond in gurgles and teethe at the instruments.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nShe rests the base of her hand hard on the bridge of my nose and hums with the buffer. In the eclipse, I can make out the double-bump of two gold bands. A mossy green fleck flies onto her mask, dangles, then falls to my paper bib. She doesn''t understand how slow a demise can be, how imperceptible-from going out for pizza on the third anniversary to ordering Chinese delivery on the fourth. I would choke on spearmint saliva trying to explain.\\r\\nAs I peel away from the plastic armrest covers to rinse, the hygienist wheels backwards on the cushioned stool until she bumps the supply cabinet. She hands me a new toothbrush, throat culture pink with a small head and soft crew cut bristles, and a pamphlet detailing the proper brush jiggle-action. I run my tongue over my teeth, knowing this is as smooth as it gets.\\r\\n---\\r\\nThose first mornings, my gums taste metallic. My orange juice stings. Crumbs stab into my elbows; their shadows stretch across the vinyl tablecloth, revealing them in clusters. Between him and me are the sports section and his slice of cold pizza. I cringe at another sip.\\r\\nHe gives me a prolonged look over the top of his shield and then turns the page, wafting his woody-spicy cologne my way. It burns my lungs and makes me a warped sort of hungry.\\r\\n\"I''m brushing,\" I explain.\\r\\nEverything in our bedroom-the maroon shag, the itchy mauve quilt, the ribbed taupe curtains-exudes that woody-spicy stink. The wet dog smell from the clothesbasket on the closet floor adds even more bite to the pungent aroma of the room. Only the antique bureau, swelling out like a baroque museum piece with claw feet and teardrop knobs, is able to protect my socks and bras and sweatpants from absorbing it all.\\r\\n\"What, your hygienist been threatening you?\"\\r\\nWe promised each other we''d never lose the drive--that we''d move cross-country to California and sell T-shirts and surf boards in a little shop on the beach--that we''d never come back. I always think maybe if we leave right now we could still escape. He would lose the weight and his hair would grow in the right places again and his eyes would open as wide as they used to; I''d sleep less and drink more and touch things again with the tips of my fingers.\\r\\nHe downs his coffee and heads off early to work. When the kitchen air clears, that familiar kitty litter odor returns-even though we have no cat. I wash last night''s dishes, watch carved-off bits of chicken fat and overripe broccoli heads swim in slow-motion rewind to the drain as if they were meant to be there all along, then go to work myself.\\r\\n---\\r\\nWith the afterimage of the computer screen burnt into my retinas, my voice strained from the customer service falsetto, and a point on the left side of my skull, behind the ear, throbbing from the too-tight headset, I drive to the pharmacy. It smells pleasantly sterile and the carpets are gray. There are rows of floss, pre- and post-rinses, picks and pokers. I choose a little of everything and continue home.\\r\\nThe TV projects varying hues, sad and happy, across the living room. Despite that, his boxer-briefs and wife beater and bowl of stale popcorn bathe in an eerily constant blue. He is stubbled and his eyes are scuffed beads.\\r\\nI go to the bathroom and whisk the shower curtain closed; I''d rather see the shadows of soap scum on the liner than the paint peeling on the shower windowsill or the torn shade or the dingy traction mat. I tape my pamphlet to the mirror and spend the night learning to use everything. I ignore the tiny square tiles all over the floor and the walls so I don''t get caught up in their complicated patterns. I pretend I can''t smell his Garden Fresh disinfectant spray hanging in the air, though I sneeze every few minutes anyway. By midnight, my gums ache and all I can taste is strong mint mixed with traces of blood. I am done.\\r\\nWhen I go to bed he is lying on his back: still awake. I try to change my clothes, but I can''t find the right drawer--every teardrop feels the same--and I decide not to bother. I stub my toe on the bedpost, and the pain swells back on me as I crawl in. He turns his head and says, \"My brother once got on some brushing kick. Brushed off all his enamel. Fourteen cavities.\" Then he thumps over onto his side, having made his point, and I know he''s asleep when his breathing turns light, steady--like a child''s.\\r\\nI''m thankful we never installed that mirror on the ceiling like we dreamed we would while we were dating--while we were kissing under feathered down and tangled in each other''s arms, when we would tumble into bed from any side and sleep wherever we landed--so I don''t have to see us now, tranquil as corpses in the sallow morning light, and I''ll never wake to witness myself gripping the edge of the mattress after I''ve tripped down that fjord in my nightmares, my body tensing and my face twisted as if I''m still about to plunge into those icy Nordic waters.\\r\\n---\\r\\nIn the morning, my mouth feels coated with dirt. Orange juice is acid on an open wound. But over the next nights, the red trails against the white sink fade to pink and then to clear. He is awake when I come to bed, but his remarks wither to huffs, then to heavy sighs.\\r\\nAs I wait him out, I think about how we used to laugh at couples that look like we do now.\\r\\nI remember how, amidst the scent of gardenias and the endless Canon in D of our wedding day, he seemed to let out one long breath--how his tuxedo, the one he wore when he proposed over that dinner of swordfish in light lemon crème, began to crease in rays of strain at the buttons to form a column of dark comets--and how fast it happened--sometime after the vows, perhaps around the time his mother unveiled four pans of coffee cake in a curious substitution for the frosted three-tier double mocha I''d expected, or as late as when we dragged ourselves across the sticky summer leather of the limousine for that final ride to the airport.\\r\\nI try to picture him young, but the wispy hologram is a film so thin it pops with the slightest pressure--a movement, a breath. I try to fantasize about leaving him, about being left by him, about us agreeing with a handshake to leave each other, but it stops there. I can''t dream up a life to follow.\\r\\nHe comes home late holding a portable, wind-up clock. The hands have phosphorescent strips and the sticker on the face is creased into a liquid-looking line that meanders from the II to the VII.\\r\\n\"What''s that for?\"\\r\\n\"The bathroom.\"\\r\\n\"Why?\"\\r\\n\"Time my showers.\" He has never taken a shower more than seven minutes long. \"I''ll just put it here,\" on the middle shelf of the wicker wall rack, atop a stack of navy face cloths. He sprays his disinfectant and its fierce Garden Freshness sends me into a sneezing fit.\\r\\nI do end up creating some uses for the clock. Countdown starts the moment I hear him drag his feet down the hallway, over the pharmacy-gray industrial carpeting, past the bathroom and into the bedroom. While time runs, I do other things: wash my face, brush my hair. I overlook the navy blue lint on the rim of the tub, the grime behind the toilet, the lush mold inside the sink''s flood hole. Forty-two minutes later, he is undoubtedly asleep--limp on the mattress.\\r\\nThen, I can begin:\\r\\nFirst, I rinse with a mildly minty plaque-loosener (2 minutes); next, I brush teeth, tongue, gums, lips--everywhere--with baking soda toothpaste (26 minutes); then I floss, twenty-three strokes per gap: ten against each tooth, three sweeping the gum in between (19 minutes); and last, I gargle with a mouthwash that makes my eyes tear, my face burn-so strong in my throat it blocks out the Garden Fresh stench (2 minutes).\\r\\nI grow more accustomed to the bedroom darkness, learning to count my steps to the bureau, to feel for nicks in the wood, to find pajamas by the texture of the fabrics. Soon, I undress and dress and maneuver as though I never needed eyes at all.\\r\\n---\\r\\nHe eats leftover meatloaf slathered in ketchup for breakfast. His temples have seemed to swell and stretch and merge under the skin on his forehead, and the lump rises and falls when he chews; he resembles a feeding gorilla.\\r\\nThough groggy, I try to remember if my change happened before or after his--whether I was the cause or the effect.\\r\\nWhile I rummage for the milk, I notice a pair of never-used pomegranate candles, in block-crystal bases, buried in the nook between the fridge and the breadbox. I used to wear red like that on my lips--that same bright shade. I could never wear it now, knowing how easily lipstick stains--but I wonder what I''d look like. I wonder how pomegranate floss would taste.\\r\\nBefore I add milk to my raisin bran, I pick out the raisins--knowing how readily they catch between the teeth--and they sit like a deposit of frosted rabbit pellets on my napkin. Since I began waking up before him to gargle, my appetite has returned--the mouthwash mint is intense enough to temper his cologne, though not enough to smother it. The metal spoon resting on my middle finger cools the spot where my skin is starting to dry and peel from the floss.\\r\\n---\\r\\nAt 1:34 a.m., he knocks. I freeze.\\r\\nI open the door. He is sitting the wrong way on a kitchen chair--straddling it, leaning forward against its back-facing the bathroom door. I never even heard him out there.\\r\\n\"Do you have to use the bathroom?\"\\r\\nHe glares at me. \"Yeah.\" There is a blanched sliver of food between his front teeth.\\r\\n\"Here. Use it.\" I step out. The floss is cutting off blood flow to the tips of my middle fingers.\\r\\n\"After you.\" The food is still there, harbored in that crevice.\\r\\nI step back in. \"You''re just gonna sit there and watch me?\"\\r\\n\"Yeah.\" He wouldn''t bother to get rid of it even if I told him it was there.\\r\\nWe stare at each other. His face and neck are blackened with bristly hair. Weak pulses of blood magnify into painful throbs at my purple fingertips. His thighs bulge off the edge of the seat.\\r\\nIn a flash I grab the knob, and before he can heave himself up and jam his swollen slippered foot in the gap, I have it locked. He slams into the door, somewhere up high--with his fists, or his elbows, or his entire lower arm--and the sound fills the bathroom, resonating in the ceramics.\\r\\nRight away I release the chokehold and soothe my fingers under cool water. I hear the chair bruise the walls as he lugs it back to the kitchen, then his slipper tread rasp against the rug in weary steps through the hallway toward the bedroom... then no noise, and I am safe.\\r\\nAfter my fingers recover, I finish flossing-and I add extra strokes, just to be sure. Then I brush again, massaging every flesh surface, stripping away anything dead I may have left the first time. The mirror reflects a flush, clear-eyed face; my lips seem fuller, darker.\\r\\nWhen I go to the bedroom, I take time to appreciate the scratched wood, the sad cold knobs, the weaves of the fabric. While I''m exposed in the dark, I take time to stretch, to knead, to memorize the softness of my skin.\\r\\n---\\r\\nI''m flossing between the top left canine and lateral incisor when I spot a single stubble hair in the sink-not quite a centimeter long. I run the water, but it won''t wash down. I use the blunt end of my brush. Then the bristled end of his. My fingernail finally does the trick. I clean my finger with antibacterial hand soap, then I clean the sink with a wad of toilet paper. Then I dry my hands, and I look around.\\r\\nThe first thing to go is the Garden Fresh disinfectant spray. Hoping to neutralize any lurking hint of it, I wrap Gardenia potpourri in gauze and hang it everywhere: the doorknob, the window lock, the sink drainpipes. I replace everything navy--the face cloths, the bath towels, the shaggy rug, the fuzzy toilet seat cover--with white lint-free things never drenched in Garden Freshness. I cut the curtain liner down and tear away the traction mat-the suction sounds like packing bubbles popping. I scour the tiles on the walls and floor with lemony-pine cleaners. With a mixture of bleach and baking soda, I polish the tub, then the toilet, then the sink; I add some to the bristles when I use his brush to scrub inside the flood hole.\\r\\nWhen I step into the tub to toss out the torn shade and re-paint the flaking sill, I notice the moon, high up and pale as bone. I open the window. The cool night air falls in, and trees rustle outside. I discover that if I stand here in the tub, and it''s past a certain hour, I can always see the moon--so every night I open the window to wait for it.\\r\\n---\\r\\nWhenever the clothesbasket overflows, whenever he drapes his belts over the back of the recliner, whenever he spills beer on the living room Oriental, whenever he brands the light switch with grease-prints--I leave things as they are. The distinct odors of the house worsen as neglected rooms surrender and deteriorate, but my bathroom stays pristine.\\r\\nI walk on the cold bathroom tiles barefoot now, and my dreams take me to the bathhouses of ancient Pompeii instead of the Norwegian Sea. When I crouch to study the festive mesh of green mint and red cinnamon floss at the top of the trash, I catch myself humming carols the next morning. The curled-up toothpaste tube begins to remind me of a young ballerina on her tummy, stretching her toes to her head.\\r\\nSometimes I floss leaning against the newly satin-finished sill, and I tell the moon that I was once a dancer-that when I was seven, I would pirouette for hours--I would sleep in my tutu. Then I extend my arms through the window, as I once would have in third arabesque, to floss between the moon and the sky--to scrape away the parched, ancient craters--and again I can imagine myself a prima ballerina princess.\\r\\nAnd only very late at night, when the trees have quieted and the door is locked and the window is open wide, the moon talks back to me. It tells me how dizzy it gets, how it questions its purpose.\\r\\n---\\r\\nA sudden snap.\\r\\nThe roller keeps spinning, and the last of the white unwaxed floss--about five inches--droops from my fist. It was my last reel, my spare.\\r\\nI have no choice. I gargle, shut the window, and leave the bathroom. The neighbors'' driveway light streams through the Venetian blinds in the bedroom like so many suns, a prison stripe spotlight for me as I tiptoe in.\\r\\nHe is on his back. I undress and dress awkwardly, shrinking away from the bright bands, thinking that he could see me exposed at any moment--but he does not sit up, does not open his eyes. I sneak into bed, stare at the ceiling and wait.\\r\\nI listen to the irregular rhythm of his breathing, but it never steadies, never strengthens. Other than that, the room is black and silent. I can feel the threads of cotton on the back of my arms and neck.\\r\\nThe light in the neighbors'' driveway clicks off. In the void above I catch glimpses of the ghosts of the veins inside and behind my eyes, cast in strange pulsing yellows that move with me no matter where I look.\\r\\nI close my eyes, turn to my side and try to force sleep. Despite the mint in my throat and on my tongue, I smell his cologne deep in the fibers of my pillow, where it will seep into my skin overnight. I hear my own blood coursing in spurts through my ears. The bed seems both incalculably large and small. My teeth are slick against my tongue, but I know gritty sugars linger in places I never reached. Before long, bacteria will consume the sugars and produce acids, then the acids will sear the soft tissue at my gumline, dissolve the minerals in my enamel, dig further for the dentin, then the pulp...\\r\\nHe rolls toward me. It takes him years. \"What''s the problem?\"\\r\\n\"Ran out of floss. Can''t finish.\"\\r\\nHe lets out a long breath--so long I think he might deflate. \"So go and get more.\" He eases himself back over, no thumping or huffing. His breathing becomes shallow and regular within seconds.\\r\\nNow that it''s dark I can dress quickly, counting nicks and knobs, sorting through piles of familiar materials, pulling things on and over, zipping up and buttoning down. I smile as I go, admiring my own adeptness. I find his wallet in the pants on top of the dirty clothes mound, which is waist-high and spilling three feet out from the closet.\\r\\nThe night air has made the car door handle cold. I pull out, shivering with the moon by my shoulder but expecting the sun on my back soon enough. I don''t worry about leaving my toothbrush behind. I''ll buy a new one in San Diego.', 'Scraping Craters by Nancy Jordan', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '10-revision-v1', '', '', '2008-02-02 16:38:11', '2008-02-03 00:38:11', '', 10, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/10-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Alcohol and nicotine pulsing through my brain, and I want to go home. I wonder if anyone''s ever overdosed on nicotine. It seems unlikely but not impossible. I''ve been sitting on this curb for 3 hours, trying to sober up, and I want to go home. People still shuffling in and out of the house from where I''d just come, still trying to reach the mystical plateau. That tiny cliff at that top of the giant hill that is just enough but not too much. Everyone chasing the light while hanging out in the dark.

Isn''t it funny that we all go out and push, push, push to get to the point that I''m at now, and then all we want is to go back down, walk backwards down that hill so we can get back to the familiar?\\r\\nI vaguely remember calling a taxi a few hours ago but hadn''t been able to convince myself that it was time to go, it was time to stop doing shots, time to quit doing lines in the bathroom; but I''d missed my chance. I''d probably missed my only chance to get back to the only place I wanted to be right now. Safe and warm, curled up on my bathroom floor. I hear car doors opening and closing. I hear engines starting. Why am I not friends with those people and why am I not leaving with them? Lying down might be a good idea, the spins have taken hold and mixed with the taste of what must have been 100 cigarettes and whatever I''d been drinking in there, it all begins to blur. \\r\\nWe all tell ourselves while we''re punishing our bodies to free our minds that it''ll be a good story, it''ll be something that will make our friends laugh, regardless of how awful the things we did were to get it. Right now, I don''t give a fuck about my friends or what they''re going to say when I tell them about how awful I feel. I don''t give a fuck because I can''t; I''m focused too hard on not freezing to death. I start to think about the snow on my back, and the cold burning feeling on my skin. If the snow was still melting on my skin, I must be alright. The house behind me is still full of people. I wonder if they''re ever going to stop. The sun will come up soon. It has to. I wonder if that''s the signal everyone inside is waiting for. The sun is up, we have to leave now. \\r\\nI sit up because my back is soaking wet.

Did I think that if I just came out and sat down that somehow, through some sort of magic, someone would come and take me home? \\r\\nI can''t breathe all that well through my nose, it''s gotten worse as the night has worn on. The lines I''d done with that girl in the bathroom weren''t helping my current situation. She''d led me in there holding my hand. I thought I was going to get laid. The reality of the situation was completely different. At the time it had all been about pushing the limits, I was fine then. Barely drunk. What''s better than a pick me up? What I know now is that it wasn''t a pick me up. It wasn''t what I had thought it was at all. I ended up doing a small line of Oxycontin on the bathroom counter. This doesn''t mix well with the amount of booze I had been drinking. I knew this wasn''t the best way to keep the party going, but I couldn''t help myself. Oh what I''d do to go back in time. My legs feel heavy, and I want to go home. My ass is numb, and I want to go home.\\r\\nThe house is surrounded by tall pines in all directions. I know this because when I wandered out to piss earlier I''d almost gotten lost on my way back in. It''s funny the details that don''t transfer over from sober to inebriated. I walked up the front steps and noticed the tall pines and hell, I''d even driven through them on my way up here. I mention this up because I''ve already thought about just walking out of here, but I''m almost positive I''ll end up as one of those people you laugh at on the news who is found 50 feet from a highway frozen at the bottom of a tree. My subconscious is trying to kill me, and I want to go home. I feel disconnected from everything, and I want to go home. The sky over the mountains is turning purple, cold darkness is giving way to light. The sun is making it''s way west. The lights on the fronts of the houses are fading, no longer the only thing providing light in the infinite darkness that is this night. I feel my stomach beginning to figure out that it''s only sifting through different types of alcohol and maybe some jell-o from those terrible jell-o shots. I''m almost certain that it''s getting ready to break free of me and find a better owner. Someone who takes care of it.\\r\\nIt seems like things have gotten quiet. I can barely hear the music inside. I was almost positive that someone would call the cops and I''d be waking up tomorrow in some county jail with ten other drunks standing around waiting to be released back into the wild. I''d almost welcome it right now. A night in the drunk tank for the ability to still feel my fingers. I want to stand up. I want to go back inside. I know I could at least find a small corner somewhere to lay down and just sleep all this off. I am soaked to the bone, the curb I''m sitting on isn''t getting any softer, and I want to go home. I can barely feel my legs anymore and my only thoughts are about my bed and how warm my house must be, and I want to go home. \\r\\nThere''s no sound now. There is nothing I can see moving around me. I feel my eyelids begin to feel heavy. I want to sleep. I want to just sleep it off. I''ll wake up in a couple hours and be sober enough to get home. I''ll be sober enough to be able to know where I am.

Alcohol and nicotine pulsing through my brain, and I want to go home. I wonder if anyone''s ever overdosed on nicotine. It seems unlikely but not impossible. I''ve been sitting on this curb for 3 hours, trying to sober up, and I want to go home. People still shuffling in and out of the house from where I''d just come, still trying to reach the mystical plateau. That tiny cliff at that top of the giant hill that is just enough but not too much. Everyone chasing the light while hanging out in the dark. Everyone on the same fabled conquest of substance; trying to get it without letting it get you. Isn''t it funny that we all go out and push, push, push to get to the point that I''m at now, and then all we want is to go back down, walk backwards down that hill so we can get back to the familiar?\n\nI vaguely remember calling a taxi a few hours ago but hadn''t been able to convince myself that it was time to go, it was time to stop doing shots, time to quit doing lines in the bathroom; but I''d missed my chance. I''d probably missed my only chance to get back to the only place I wanted to be right now. Safe and warm, curled up on my bathroom floor. I hear car doors opening and closing. I hear engines starting. Why am I not friends with those people and why am I not leaving with them? Lying down might be a good idea, the spins have taken hold and mixed with the taste of what must have been 100 cigarettes and whatever I''d been drinking in there, it all begins to blur. \n\nWe all tell ourselves while we''re punishing our bodies to free our minds that it''ll be a good story, it''ll be something that will make our friends laugh, regardless of how awful the things we did were to get it. Right now, I don''t give a fuck about my friends or what they''re going to say when I tell them about how awful I feel. I don''t give a fuck because I can''t; I''m focused too hard on not freezing to death. I start to think about the snow on my back, and the cold burning feeling on my skin. If the snow was still melting on my skin, I must be alright. The house behind me is still full of people. I wonder if they''re ever going to stop. The sun will come up soon. It has to. I wonder if that''s the signal everyone inside is waiting for. The sun is up, we have to leave now. \n\nI sit up because my back is soaking wet. The cold had felt good when I first laid down in it, now it was just another reason I needed to leave. I try to stand but decide it''s a bad idea and sit back down. My ass feeling like it was separated from it''s long lost twin and then reunited. Inside may have been the better option. Thinking about it now I don''t know why I came out here. Did I think that if I just came out and sat down that somehow, through some sort of magic, someone would come and take me home? \n\nI can''t breathe all that well through my nose, it''s gotten worse as the night has worn on. The lines I''d done with that girl in the bathroom weren''t helping my current situation. She''d led me in there holding my hand. I thought I was going to get laid. The reality of the situation was completely different. At the time it had all been about pushing the limits, I was fine then. Barely drunk. What''s better than a pick me up? What I know now is that it wasn''t a pick me up. It wasn''t what I had thought it was at all. I ended up doing a small line of Oxycontin on the bathroom counter. This doesn''t mix well with the amount of booze I had been drinking. I knew this wasn''t the best way to keep the party going, but I couldn''t help myself. Oh what I''d do to go back in time. My legs feel heavy, and I want to go home. My ass is numb, and I want to go home.\n\nThe house is surrounded by tall pines in all directions. I know this because when I wandered out to piss earlier I''d almost gotten lost on my way back in. It''s funny the details that don''t transfer over from sober to inebriated. I walked up the front steps and noticed the tall pines and hell, I''d even driven through them on my way up here. I mention this up because I''ve already thought about just walking out of here, but I''m almost positive I''ll end up as one of those people you laugh at on the news who is found 50 feet from a highway frozen at the bottom of a tree. My subconscious is trying to kill me, and I want to go home. I feel disconnected from everything, and I want to go home. The sky over the mountains is turning purple, cold darkness is giving way to light. The sun is making it''s way west. The lights on the fronts of the houses are fading, no longer the only thing providing light in the infinite darkness that is this night.

(125, 1, '2020-06-03 03:41:40', '2020-06-03 11:41:40', 'I watched my mother, once, holding a corpse the size of a honey baked ham. Late evening. Corner of our old street. From my seat on a cloud I recognized its form; watched its tissues dissolve like blood sausage on her just-manicured nails; the spoils of its bloody clots lingering over her lacquered loveliness. Eyes dry. Cheeks sucked in, she buffed her nails, turned on heels that hurt the pavement as the ignoble puddle sizzled, frothed, burped and then congealed into her story.\\r\\nThis, of course, is a dream. But most of my ghost stories, which are often nightmares, occur inside my head. I’ve never been afraid of the real ghosts because they are shy and scurry away as soon as they’ve been spotted.  But they remain lodged inside our heads and make their pre-Broadway appearance night after night in our skulls. That’s what dreams are—ghosts playing hide and seek inside those craniums. \\r\\nTake this other one. It won’t leave me at all. The best way I could describe it would be like this:\\r\\nEarly one evening, six naked men, calmly observed by 36 six onlookers in the children’s section of Central Park wrestled a white pit bull with blue eyes and blond lashes. Why they were naked and why one of them seemed more to be humping the dog’s belly only God knows. Drawn by the moans of the comatose canine, each man pried its mouth open and took his turn looking down the throat of the shivering creature. One man reported he saw shreds of a mongrel the dog had eaten and said that that was what the world was turning into; nations full of mongrels. Another said he saw a lot of pink that looked like the inside of his wife’s vagina and that he’d never love a woman again. Another got up off his dusty ass and said he’d decline to look. If a similar fate awaited him he’d rather die.\\r\\nHe walked towards a little girl, reported to be about five, whose mother said: “Here Mister, take my baby.”\\r\\nTenderly, he removed her yellow satin frock, silver shoes and hand in hand into bushes behind the swings they walked. All 36 onlookers heard the girl moan and the man scream in agony. He was found dead. \\r\\nGlorious day it was when yet another pried the stiffening creature’s dentures so wide he buried his head deep inside its mouth and then, just then:\\r\\nBig Doggy, his face a bloody red mess, snapped its jaws tight and stood on his hind legs.\\r\\nEveryone heard the wrestler’s neck snap but was more hypnotized by his erect cock.\\r\\nGood Doggy thrust his head back and the man’s waist turned a Calypso twist.\\r\\nThis brought wild applause and thus began the carnival in Central Park that is still going on.\r\n \r\nThis is an apocalyptic dream that portends disaster and the breakdown of all boundaries that keep me, perhaps, alienated from my own animality. But it scares me. A loincloth separates me and the dog. It represents untamed vitality--the Life Force. I can’t go there. I won’t go there. The Super-ego is huge. I sense my late grandmother’s presence. I can only watch.\\r\\nThen\\r\\nI have no children. But a ghost who is a little boy is with me. He is 7 years old, the dawn of moral consciousness in Catholicism. He says that the aftermath of God’s Uteral Prolapse was not Genesis after all. He says he dreamed that that Garden was the imagined Uterus God willed to grow outside of him.\\r\\n“Daddy”, he murmurs in his sleep, “at five hundred inches, there’s only so much a waist can grow. Genesis is yet to come.” As the 747 climbs through the billowy baby blues and soft cotton coils, my sweet little boy swears he sees in-Vitro wackos holding fish bowls under some squatting silhouette.\\r\\nOh, my Lord, it is a bloody heave weighing in at two hundred pounds—all glorious fat fried to a crisp at the edges.

The best way I could describe it would be like this:\n\nEarly one evening, six naked men, calmly observed by 36 six onlookers in the children’s section of Central Park wrestled a white pit bull with blue eyes and blond lashes. Why they were naked and why one of them seemed more to be humping the dog’s belly only God knows. Drawn by the moans of the comatose canine, each man pried its mouth open and took his turn looking down the throat of the shivering creature. One man reported he saw shreds of a mongrel the dog had eaten and said that that was what the world was turning into; nations full of mongrels. Another said he saw a lot of pink that looked like the inside of his wife’s vagina and that he’d never love a woman again. Another got up off his dusty ass and said he’d decline to look. If a similar fate awaited him he’d rather die.\n\nHe walked towards a little girl, reported to be about five, whose mother said: “Here Mister, take my baby.”\n\nTenderly, he removed her yellow satin frock, silver shoes and hand in hand into bushes behind the swings they walked. All 36 onlookers heard the girl moan and the man scream in agony. He was found dead. \n\nGlorious day it was when yet another pried the stiffening creature’s dentures so wide he buried his head deep inside its mouth and then, just then:\n\nBig Doggy, his face a bloody red mess, snapped its jaws tight and stood on his hind legs.\n\nEveryone heard the wrestler’s neck snap but was more hypnotized by his erect cock.\n\nGood Doggy thrust his head back and the man’s waist turned a Calypso twist.\n\nThis brought wild applause and thus began the carnival in Central Park that is still going on.\n \nThis is an apocalyptic dream that portends disaster and the breakdown of all boundaries that keep me, perhaps, alienated from my own animality. But it scares me. A loincloth separates me and the dog. It represents untamed vitality--the Life Force. I can’t go there. I won’t go there. The Super-ego is huge. I sense my late grandmother’s presence. I can only watch.\n\nThen\n\nI have no children. But a ghost who is a little boy is with me. He is 7 years old, the dawn of moral consciousness in Catholicism. He says that the aftermath of God’s Uteral Prolapse was not Genesis after all. He says he dreamed that that Garden was the imagined Uterus God willed to grow outside of him.\n\n“Daddy”, he murmurs in his sleep, “at five hundred inches, there’s only so much a waist can grow.

(131, 1, '2020-06-04 03:49:34', '2020-06-04 11:49:34', 'When things are illuminated, life is beautiful. Luminosity is, indeed, a wonderful thing. You are anchored in your body and that body is easy to please. You only have to honor the integrity of your senses. The bad smells bad, and the good is to be luxuriated in. You feel your senses acutely and realize you were blessed with them because they make you into a deep participant in life. Others have their senses too and you share yours with them. Social intercourse is your way into earthly heaven.\\r\\nYou are not alone.\\r\\nLife belongs to you. Life can be shaped according to your vision and by the grace of its better possibilities. You love life and intend to affirm it by being a co-author in the shaping of a destiny you have faith in: it can only be for your good.\\r\\n At the age of twenty, clutching the hand of your seventy-two year old grandmother, you board a plane on the tarmac of a tiny island nation with $120 dollars in your pocket. When you land in the United States of America you decide this is truly the first day of your life because you have adopted a new country as the one that complements your values, dreams and big capacity for joy. \\r\\n The next day you resist invitations to explore the city of your new home—Atlanta—because you need to find a job. You put on your suit, take a train that turns out to be the wrong one and enter a city in which, during the next five hours, you will become lost countless number of times. You apply for over twenty jobs and finally take a break by sitting on the curb of a busy street to take off your shoes and massage your feet. \\r\\n You end up getting a job in a bank where you work for a year to finance your first year of college tuition. You read voraciously and use some of your college money to buy too many books. No Matter. You are reading about two per week. The perfectibility of your mind is a child’s fantasy carried over into early adult life that you cannot give up.\\r\\n Life is on your side.\\r\\n You enter college full-time and work in a bank for thirty-five to forty hours per week. You impose an exacting regimen on yourself, and people say you’re the most disciplined person they know. You write tons of newspaper editorials and make around $1,000 from your writing in one year. You maintain an A+ average, graduate magna cum laude and take off a year to write a novel. You’re ruthless with yourself when the rejections come in. For every rejection you receive, you send out thirty more submissions. You decide to get an agent. That proves just as difficult as finding a publisher. You snag one after 250 rejections.\\r\\n Graduate school is tough, but in your third week you’ve already decided on a dissertation topic. You identify the month and date of your graduation in five years time. \\r\\n It all comes through as you planned. You graduate four and a half years later with a Ph.D in philosophy. It hasn’t all been easy. You’ve sometimes been weighted down by mood swings. You’ve fallen in love, fallen out of love, and left your partner for another person. But your creativity has never left you. You write your dissertation in little over a year, and you get a good teaching position.\\r\\n Reality is there for you to shape it.\\r\\n You write and publish your first book with a good publisher in nineteen months. You read like a book addict. You are always writing. Ideas compete among themselves and all come crashing in your head, leaving you in a state of heightened bliss—your hand cannot keep pace with the speed at which your thoughts and ideas are targeting and then shattering you. You feel like a god.\\r\\n You give numerous talks in Europe and the United States and you feel more at home in your adopted country.\\r\\n Things are illuminated. Then, life comes crashing down.\\r\\nYou collapse in your bath tub and doctors say it’s anxiety. But you sense it’s more than that.  During the next couple of years you carry a constant Death Baby inside of you, one that dreams of and yearns for death. It feels like you’re being eaten from the inside by this creature. But still, you write. Poetry comes flowing out of you like mineral water from hidden rocks. You’ll spend the next couple of years revising each poem for a minimum of two years. Death Baby grows and you feed him little pills that satisfy him for a while. For one year it feels like you are drowning, but the poems just come pouring out. In spite of it all, you teach, think and write and finish a new book.\\r\\n Suicide seems like a good thing to think about. Suicide is calming. You empty a bottle of pills in your hand one night and look at them for an hour. You contemplate them like little religious icons. Religious icons, though, belong on a shelf. You put them back in the bottle and line them up with your other bottled icons. They make a shrine you neurotically fetishize.\\r\\n Suicide seems like a real possibility. You begin to think about it constantly. The pain is unbearable. You think: how to do it? One day to ease the pain you take a lot of pills. At 2 a.m you still can’t sleep. You feed yourself more Xanax tablets. Beginning from the morning you end up having taken twelve tablets by 2:30 a.m. You slip in and out of consciousness and then something shifts. You enter the dark hour, a period where it feels like you’re slipping over to the other side. You don some clothes and somehow walk to the hospital. You are interred in the psychiatric ward for four days. Bedlam is not glamorous. You wonder which way is home.\\r\\n Life is still on your side.\\r\\n Bipolar is the most lethal of all mental illnesses. It accounts for more suicides than the other illnesses and can catapult a person into the stratospheres of euphoria and then down into the darkest doldrums of depression and despair. When in the hypomanic phase one can feel powerful, be extremely creative. You hear this as a diagnosis is rattled off to you. It makes sense, you think. And you begin to feel comforted. You are prescribed Seroquel and Abilify and you begin to move once again in the world. The poems keep coming, the sequel to your first book progresses and you feel elation. Depression comes but it does not last for very long. Then you begin to sink, deep, deep. You’re drowning and you can’t breathe and the vortex keeps swirling. When you get out, you spend a few months staggering through life, often pacing the floors like a caged jaguar with too much energy.\\r\\n Life is tired. Life becomes suspended.

(132, 1, '2008-11-14 09:04:43', '2008-11-14 17:04:43', 'When things are illuminated, life is beautiful. Luminosity is, indeed, a wonderful thing. You are anchored in your body and that body is easy to please. You only have to honor the integrity of your senses. The bad smells bad, and the good is to be luxuriated in. You feel your senses acutely and realize you were blessed with them because they make you into a deep participant in life. Others have their senses too and you share yours with them. Social intercourse is your way into earthly heaven.\n\nYou are not alone.\n\nLife belongs to you. Life can be shaped according to your vision and by the grace of its better possibilities. You love life and intend to affirm it by being a co-author in the shaping of a destiny you have faith in: it can only be for your good.\n<!--more-->\n At the age of twenty, clutching the hand of your seventy-two year old grandmother, you board a plane on the tarmac of a tiny island nation with $120 dollars in your pocket. When you land in the United States of America you decide this is truly the first day of your life because you have adopted a new country as the one that complements your values, dreams and big capacity for joy. \n\n The next day you resist invitations to explore the city of your new home—Atlanta—because you need to find a job. You put on your suit, take a train that turns out to be the wrong one and enter a city in which, during the next five hours, you will become lost countless number of times. You apply for over twenty jobs and finally take a break by sitting on the curb of a busy street to take off your shoes and massage your feet. \n\n You end up getting a job in a bank where you work for a year to finance your first year of college tuition. You read voraciously and use some of your college money to buy too many books. No Matter. You are reading about two per week. The perfectibility of your mind is a child’s fantasy carried over into early adult life that you cannot give up.\n\n Life is on your side.\n\n You enter college full-time and work in a bank for thirty-five to forty hours per week. You impose an exacting regimen on yourself, and people say you’re the most disciplined person they know. You write tons of newspaper editorials and make around $1,000 from your writing in one year. You maintain an A+ average, graduate magna cum laude and take off a year to write a novel. You’re ruthless with yourself when the rejections come in. For every rejection you receive, you send out thirty more submissions. You decide to get an agent. That proves just as difficult as finding a publisher. You snag one after 250 rejections.\n\n Graduate school is tough, but in your third week you’ve already decided on a dissertation topic. You identify the month and date of your graduation in five years time. \n\n It all comes through as you planned. You graduate four and a half years later with a Ph.D in philosophy. It hasn’t all been easy. You’ve sometimes been weighted down by mood swings. You’ve fallen in love, fallen out of love, and left your partner for another person. But your creativity has never left you. You write your dissertation in little over a year, and you get a good teaching position.\n\n Reality is there for you to shape it.\n\n You write and publish your first book with a good publisher in nineteen months. You read like a book addict. You are always writing. Ideas compete among themselves and all come crashing in your head, leaving you in a state of heightened bliss—your hand cannot keep pace with the speed at which your thoughts and ideas are targeting and then shattering you. You feel like a god.\n\n You give numerous talks in Europe and the United States and you feel more at home in your adopted country.\n\n Things are illuminated. Then, life comes crashing down.\n\nYou collapse in your bath tub and doctors say it’s anxiety. But you sense it’s more than that.  During the next couple of years you carry a constant Death Baby inside of you, one that dreams of and yearns for death. It feels like you’re being eaten from the inside by this creature. But still, you write. Poetry comes flowing out of you like mineral water from hidden rocks. You’ll spend the next couple of years revising each poem for a minimum of two years. Death Baby grows and you feed him little pills that satisfy him for a while. For one year it feels like you are drowning, but the poems just come pouring out. In spite of it all, you teach, think and write and finish a new book.\n\n Suicide seems like a good thing to think about. Suicide is calming. You empty a bottle of pills in your hand one night and look at them for an hour. You contemplate them like little religious icons. Religious icons, though, belong on a shelf. You put them back in the bottle and line them up with your other bottled icons. They make a shrine you neurotically fetishize.\n\n Suicide seems like a real possibility. You begin to think about it constantly. The pain is unbearable. You think: how to do it? One day to ease the pain you take a lot of pills. At 2 a.m you still can’t sleep. You feed yourself more Xanax tablets. Beginning from the morning you end up having taken twelve tablets by 2:30 a.m. You slip in and out of consciousness and then something shifts. You enter the dark hour, a period where it feels like you’re slipping over to the other side. You don some clothes and somehow walk to the hospital. You are interred in the psychiatric ward for four days. Bedlam is not glamorous. You wonder which way is home.\n\n Life is still on your side.\n\n Bipolar is the most lethal of all mental illnesses. It accounts for more suicides than the other illnesses and can catapult a person into the stratospheres of euphoria and then down into the darkest doldrums of depression and despair. When in the hypomanic phase one can feel powerful, be extremely creative. You hear this as a diagnosis is rattled off to you. It makes sense, you think. And you begin to feel comforted. You are prescribed Seroquel and Abilify and you begin to move once again in the world. The poems keep coming, the sequel to your first book progresses and you feel elation. Depression comes but it does not last for very long. Then you begin to sink, deep, deep. You’re drowning and you can’t breathe and the vortex keeps swirling. When you get out, you spend a few months staggering through life, often pacing the floors like a caged jaguar with too much energy.\n\n Life is tired. Life becomes suspended. Life needs a break—from You!\n\n Lithium Carbonate—a salt—is used to treat, among other things, bipolar disorder. You are hopeful. You feel relieved; finally something to quiet the Death Baby.

But no, you want to watch her watching you and wonder how God made bodies but God didn''t make minds? And you didn''t believe her, so you pushed her down, again and again.

Truth be told, didn''t you want her to wonder how God made bodies? And he didn''t believe her. He pushed her away. She fought back but he broke her. He lied. He killed her.

He held her hand and wiped sweat beads from her forehead with a damp cloth.\n<!--more-->\n“It hurts, daddy.” said the innocent child. \n\n“I know it does, but Daddy is right here.” James assured her as he squeezed her hand tighter. \n\nAfter several minutes of lying awake in agony, Robin once again drifted off to sleep. James let go of her hand, placing it softly on her stomach.. Her breaths were slow and deep, sometimes disturbed by a watery coughing bout. Her chest rose and fell slowly, her face flushed. Long brown locks of hair lay drenched in sweat and tears against her pillow.\n\nJames slipped into the living room next to a dimly lit fire. Was he a good parent? His thoughts raced. Sadness pulsated through him. He had to remain calm, he had to tell himself that she would pull through. His mind froze in numbness as he gazed at the orange glow on the wall. \n\nAnother cry in pain.\n\n “I’m here Robin,” he said as he took his seat in the chair and rubbed her shoulder. She began coughing for a time that seemed endless, followed by a horrible moan. Her entire body was shivering, each muscle tensed as tight as her weak body could manage. Her eyes closed once more and she fell back into slumber. He returned to the living room for the plastic bag and a glass of water.\n\n“Robin,” he whispered. Her eyes opened slowly and she glanced up at him. He handed her the glass of water and poured the contents of the plastic bag into his hand. “Take this,” A small blue pill resided in his grasp. She parted her lips just long enough for him to lay it on her tongue. Water from the cup rushed into her mouth as she drank, some of it spilling onto her shirt.\n\n“Does this mean I will get better?” she asked between short breaths.\n\n“You will never be sick again,” he told her. She smiled and nestled back into her sheets. “Goodnight Robin.”\n\nJames left his daughter’s room slowly that night, knowing that he had taken from her the pain, taken from her the sickness. Knowing that he had given her the gift of eternal rest.\n\n<em>Jake Wickenhofer has been writing since before he was ten.

(155, 1, '2020-06-08 05:02:30', '2020-06-08 13:02:30', 'Waiting at a bus stop on a redbrick pedestrian walkway, flanked by street lamps, surrounding a bubbling fountain that a flock of geese call their playground, where early morning risers throw away their pennies in exchange for loathly dreams, where a little girl is asking her grandmother what “cobblestones” are, a group of students and businessmen are boarding the mid-day bus system that operates several routes throughout the city of Fort Collins, Colorado. Others, who search for more viable means of transportation, are riding their bikes through downtown, across the Foothills trail, by an out-door venue where a band playing Bill Evan’s Autumn Leaves is tinting everyone’s moods with the saccharine modesty of a mid-Summer’s day, beneath a 19th century archway that leads to an alleyway encroached in vines and a cool shade that blankets clothing in chalk and factory ashes, that splits hair, that has a woody, robust smell from someone smoking a cigar outside of Cozzola’s Pizza three blocks away. \\r\\nThe year is 1864, sometime in June; Camp Collins, an outpost of the United States Army in the Colorado Region is being destroyed by floods from the Cache La Poudre River, which sits adjacent to the camp. Camp Collins is reestablished as Fort Collins several miles down the river. In the year 1900, Patrick Whelton is feeding sugar beats to his sheep, the Great Western sugar processing plant is being finished in Loveland, and Percy Gray is slaughtering one of his sheep in his rickety, wooden shack so that he can feed his family of four children and his wife, who has been laying in a stiff bed with the flu for three weeks. \\r\\nDuring the spring, the kids at Shepherdson Elementary get a two-week break from classes. A group of friends place a hundred heads of cattails under the wheels of every parked car on their street, bringing an artificial winter to Fort Collins by midday until the afternoon spring rain pulls the fluff out of the air. The fluff disappears in streams that flow down street gullies into the city’s sewer system, which scatter the seeds along the banks of the Cache La Poudre River basin and give birth to hundreds of new cattails by the following year. \\r\\nTomorrow, a huge flock of geese will be flying over a forest of willow trees towards a small, communal lake where a young girl will be sharing popcorn with all the other geese. And several miles away, 13 year-old Todd Bennet will be being rushed to the hospital after being bitten by a rabid bat that he’d found lying in the grass in his backyard. And Mrs. Moter, who creates mosaics out of glass, will be finishing up her mural for her church. And Mr. Hath, who lives next to the famous motorcycle mechanic, will die of cancer at the age of 97 while the family two blocks down the street will celebrate the birth of their new-born child, James. \\r\\nAnd some college student will be dry heaving in another person’s bathroom at 2 in the morning. And a girl and her best friend will think they’re being followed by the blue truck with the paint peeling off its doors. And brothers Ian and Kyle will be selling lemonade at the corner of Omega and Harmony, while a homeless man smokes skunk beneath the bridge. And Travis, the 11-year old German shepherd, will fall asleep on his owner’s woodpile and never wake up again, while the jet-black crows perched on the three-story Victorian home will caw and squawk an opus from hell. \\r\\n	And when the air is foggy in September, an old man will walk his dog, Rusty, along the sidewalk that is adjacent to the black, iron fence; through the neighborhood where a child once let his imagination run loose, where bike gangs had wars with wooden swords and air-soft guns, and nobody felt any pain because the future was unpredictable and the past was new. And someone will be giving sermons outside the Vineyard Church. And someone will be chasing after the cards that the air picked up and threw across Edora Park. And the railroad spike, the oddly-shaped bush, the fifteen-foot telephone pole, her crystal blue eyes, the color of the man’s skin, the delinquent shoes sitting in the middle of the road, the black silhouette of the murderer’s hair, the sound of laughter, the hallucinations, the hopes, the dreams, the thrills, the pain, will all be a bunch of hazy memories to the old, decrepit child with the ashes in his hair.\\r\\nIn the morning of every day, Ethan Isaiah is shaky, sitting on a miniature stool in the middle of the tomato patch that has been decomposing since his wife, Irene, died of ovarian cancer last month. His chapped hands grasp an empty whiskey bottle that he pulls up to his mouth; looking through it, the world is a glossy blur, a scent of fermented grains and organic compost that sigh for a deep, longing paradise. He envisions himself as a child again, living back in South Carolina before his family flew to Colorado, lugging a sack of fresh tomatoes back to his father’s beat-up truck, swimming in the crystal, clear water of Lake Jocassee at night with his younger sister, Natalie, and his cousin, Tom; the moon’s reflection a shimmering scintillate on the black, marbled water. He envisions the sun molding over the Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite; followed by a thousand bodies of the sea crashing over her fragile, naked body until she rumples and dissolves like soggy, charcoaled paper down a sink drain. \\r\\nA robin flies down from a willow tree and sheds its beak next to a fuzzy caterpillar that wriggles up through the soil. Brown, wrinkled tomatoes putrefy the writhing earth, providing a feeding frenzy for all types of insects. Ants scurry up Ethan’s dirty jeans, across his gristly arms, through his matted, black hair, between his swollen gums and down his husky throat. A car alarm echoes out from West Mulberry Street, where a college student is trying to explain to an old man that it was all an accident.

My wife and I emerged into a snow-globe world where the flakes came down in clots as large as rabbit tails.   The fresh snow erased the imperfections in a still-transforming area of the south Loop, painting the cracked sidewalks and vacant lots with a coat of temporary innocence.\\r\\n     We leaned together in a human teepee for support, Jill because she was wearing high-heel boots and was five months pregnant and me because of the bottle of wine.  Jill had wet her lips with the Zinfandel to toast our anniversary and I had felt compelled to finish the remaining four and a half glasses before the check.  The result was that I was less help to her than she was to me.\\r\\n     As we inched toward our car on Wells Street, a man staggered into the street waving his arms and jacket at a passing sedan.  The car braked, fish-tailed in the slush and then accelerated, missing the man by the width of its rear view mirror.  The man yelled unintelligibly, as the tail lights dissolved into the cataract of the storm.   \\r\\n     “Is he coming over here?”  Jill’s fingers dug through my coat into the flesh of my forearm, as if the added pressure could transfer her welling anxiety to me.\\r\\n     “Of course,” I said, meaning to be funny.  (I’m told I find myself quite hilarious when imbibing.)\\r\\n     A few seconds later, the man’s stumbling trajectory converged with ours. \\r\\n     “Please help me.  It hurts.  Help me.  My head,” His stained winter coat was off, pressed to the right side of his scalp.  “Look. It hurts.  My head,”\\r\\n     He pulled the jacket away from his bald skull to reveal a deep two inch gash, which seemed in no hurry to stop bleeding.  Blood had darkened the side of his jacket, his sweatshirt, his jeans.  A drop fell into the crust of fresh snow and radiated outward, as if the flakes wished to share their gory find.    \\r\\n     Honestly, I didn’t want to help.  My first thought was for my wife’s safety and to a lesser degree my own.  The man seemed erratic, the wound more likely the result a blow than a fall.  And even if he proved injured but harmless, I had my wife shivering next to me and a bottle of California’s finest clouding my judgment.  Did I have to get involved?    \\r\\n     Valet #1 came trotting down the block, perhaps in aid to an obvious scene of distress.  Valet #1 slowed, as my wife asked him to return to the restaurant for help, and then continued toward the lot, as if the question had been in Aramaic.  Valets #2 and #3 feigned deafness as they passed. \\r\\n     I dialed 911, while arguing with my wife to return to the car.  All the while, the injured man kept us current with an on-going, fragmented account of his pain.  It was too late to walk away.\\r\\n     I summed up the situation for the emergency operator, still pleading with my wife via facial contortions and hand gestures.  I provided our location.  I attempted to answer the dispatcher’s clarifying questions.\\r\\n     “I don’t know if he’s been drinking or on drugs.”  I told the dispatcher.\\r\\n     “I’M NOT ON DRUGS!”  The injured man’s scream was loud enough to freeze the valets in their tracks and the breath in my throat.  The operator did not need me to repeat his answer.\\r\\n     I hung up, my hands shaking from more than cold.  With additional begging, my wife finally relented and went to warm up the car, where she promised to keep watch.  I promised I would be fine.\\r\\n     Still agitated, the man tried to walk away.  Repeatedly, I gently led him back to the tree where we’d first met.  I tried to calm him as best I could.  \\r\\n     “Keep the pressure on, it’s okay, help is coming, don’t sit down, you’re going to be okay.”  \\r\\nBut really I was thinking how lucky I was.  In ten minutes my end of the ordeal would be over, the wounded man’s still in progress and uncertain.  He may or not have been homeless, but was surely somewhere on the left of prosperity’s Bell Curve.  Even after the ambulance came, even if he received prompt medical attention, how ‘okay’ would things really be for him?  \\r\\nThe fire truck created its own slow motion effect, as it closed tentatively along the still unplowed street.  The siren grew with the intensity of the reflected light. Then the alarm cut silent, leaving only the revolving red strobe to mark area of emergency.\\r\\nAs the first firefighter leapt from the truck, I began to guide the injured man.  Before I could take a second step, the three valets swept past me like a pack of black-jacketed Dalmatians.  They yelped and hopped around the firemen, suddenly too helpful, seeking some imaginary scrap of credit that was somehow infinitely more important to them than to me.\\r\\n     An ambulance arrived and a scrambling paramedic came bearing gear.  He threw a blanket over the injured man’s shoulders. I knew then I could no longer add anything to the situation.  \\r\\n     I stepped outside the radius of the flashing lights.  At that moment, I was no longer an active player, not even a spectator.  I was miles from being a hero, and in fact did little more than the bare minimum, what anyone would reasonably expect if they were in similar peril.  And yet how many had ignored him before my wife and I stopped?  How many more would have passed if we didn’t?\\r\\nI climbed inside our climate controlled car and swept flakes from my lashes and brow.  My wife had questions, but I needed a moment to process.  She pulled into the street, past the resolving spectacle, and we disappeared into the whiteout, as anonymous as the man we almost didn’t help.\\r\\n<em>Randy Kohl has also been published in Pology Magazine, Kaleidoscopic Resonance and Perigee: publication for the arts.</em>', 'The I of the Storm by Randy Kohl', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-i-of-the-storm-by-randy-kohl', '', '', '2020-06-09 05:11:53', '2020-06-09 13:11:53', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=159', 0, 'post', '', 2);

She now sits on Ellis Island politely checking green cards and work visas, reminding the huddled masses to wipe their feet on the way in, worried they might stay too long.\\r\\nOne of my roommates, Eimear, arrived in America three weeks ago from Ireland.  She didn’t arrive by boat and has yet to visit Lady Liberty.  In fact, Eimear isn’t even planning to say long, but would like to work while she’s here.\\r\\nIn order to work in the United Sates, however, non-citizens need three things:\\r\\n1. Valid identification\r\n2. Work visa\r\n3. United States social security number\\r\\nEven though she has an appropriate passport and visa, Eimear is having as difficult a time being issued a social security card as many of us will have collecting social security benefits.\\r\\nThis is especially unfortunate because Eimear might have found a job at the Build-A-Bear Workshop, a toy store where children design and construct their own stuffed bears.  Build-A-Bear is the salad bar of toy stores, and as soon as she’s issued a social security number, Eimear will begin walking children through their bear buffet in Times Square.\\r\\n<i>(Times Square is an exciting chaos of light and sound where most tourists take their first bite from the Big Apple. Like the strip in Las Vegas, the French Quarter in New Orleans, and the McDonalds in Montana, Times Square is the social center of our city. Sinatra once sang that “If I can make it there, I’ll make it anywhere.”  The same holds true for a child wanting to build a bear at the Build-A-Bear Workshop in Times Square.  Can he/she make one there?  Yes.  With over 200 locations in malls nationwide, can he/she also make one anywhere?  Same answer. Yes.)</i>\\r\\nAfter completing all the necessary paperwork, Eimear arrived at the Build-A-Bear Workshop at 10:45, fifteen minutes before her scheduled 11:00 interview.  Eimear didn’t realize, however, that you don’t <i>interview</i> to work at the Build-A-Bear Workshop, you <i>audition.</i>  This audition is held for a group of twenty candidates andincludes, but is not limited to:\\r\\n• An oral recitation of the Build-A-Bear pledge, from memory.\r\n• An improvised group presentation entitled: “Build a memory.  Build a Bear.”\r\n• A personal testimony covering “my definition of teamwork,” “a time when I touched someone’s life,” and “what makes me special.”\r\n• A 150 question ethics exam meant to evaluate whether or not the potential bear builder might one day qualify for relocation to Santa’s Workshop.\\r\\nOne applicant was so overcome by her own “a time when I touched someone’s life” story that, weeping, she had to be escorted from the room.  Perhaps behind closed doors the interviewer told the girl that the Build-A-Bear Workshop would probably be too emotionally demanding an environment for someone with her sensitive temperament.\\r\\nOr, she might have immediately been named employee of the month.\\r\\nEimear wasn’t as fortunate.  After the three hour audition / interview, Eimear arrived at our apartment emotionally exhausted.\\r\\n“How did it go,” I asked.\\r\\n“I didn’t offer to work for free like the crying girl did, but I think it went quite well.”\\r\\n“The crying girl?  What crying girl?”\\r\\n“The one who told a story about how she touched someone’s life by shaving her head because her friend went bald.  I don’t know.  I was fighting a wicked hangover and was having quite a hard time paying attention through her blubbering.”\\r\\n“You interviewed at a toy store with a hangover?!”\\r\\nDespite her condition at the interview (and after two subsequent call-backs), Eimear was offered a job at the Build-A-Bear Workshop – and she should have been.  Even at her worst, Eimear is magnificent.\\r\\nEven Eimear, however, doesn’t deny the irony of her own story.\\r\\nArriving hung-over at a Build-A-Bear interview is like showing up pregnant for a Snow White audition.  The same rules apply.\\r\\nIn a world where image is everything, smile. It’s what’s on the outside that counts.\\r\\n<em>You can read more of Bryan''s work on his blog, <a href=\"http://www.sometimesroadsdiverge.blogspot.com\">sometimesroadsdiverge.blogspot.com</a></em>\r\n', 'Build a Memory.

I grab the towel off of the rack and cover my face to dry. I try to lift it away, but it sticks. A movie starts and in an instant I hear soft music. I’m transported to a dance, watching so many happy couples dance in the dim light. There’s my roommate, my neighbors, and all my other friends. Our song is playing. I return to the present. One drop from each eye is reflected on the towel. Drama is not for me, so I won’t have it. I step out of the room, all wrapped up. My body is cold, and my heart is frozen.\\r\\n<em>Kristine Guadagno is a college sophomore from Boston.

She tosses her damp hair over her shoulder as she swings her bag into a seat, and slides in after it.\\r\\nThree rows ahead of him, she is hyper-real, each strand of hair haloed as the fluorescent tube bulb overhead picks up the droplets of rain clinging there. She fidgets - can she sense his eyes upon her? – and pulls her phone from her bag. The screen lights up as she flips the phone open and closed. No messages. She tosses her phone back into her bag and turns to face the window.\\r\\nHer face thrown back by the dark window is what Rory expected; she is pale and strong featured. The rain on the outside of the glass gouges across the reflection of her face in streaks as the bus hits a straight road and moves up a gear. The two sit in silence as the bus trundles on through sleeping London. If she does sense his attention, she makes no sign of it.\\r\\nThe bus slows once more, but passes the next stop without pausing when the driver sees no passengers waiting there. The blonde girl pulls her phone from her bag again, distractedly. No messages. Who was she expecting a text from at this time of night, Rory wonders.\\r\\nAnother stop, this time to let off a passenger who had been sitting on the upstairs deck. The drunken woman lurches off into the night, and the driver hesitates at his wheel as he peers into the darkness after her, willing her home safely. The blonde girl shifts restlessly in her seat; she is eager to get home herself and there are only a few stops left to travel.\\r\\nSlowly, slowly, the bus pulls away onto the road again. It is the darkest point of the night; moon and stars have set, but there is yet to be even the slightest chink of light in the eastern sky. The streetlights cast the world as orange and dull, reflecting hazily off of the wet humps of parked cars. The bus headlights shine straight, illuminating the rear of the night bus ahead.\\r\\nThe penultimate stop; the driver slows and carries on past when he sees that it too is empty. Rory knows that time is short now, minutes only. But he does nothing but watch the blonde girl as she checks her phone for a third time, and, once again, is disappointed. She places it back into her bag and zips it up.\\r\\nPreparing for the short walk ahead of her, the girl pulls her hair back and rotates her shoulders as she inches towards the edge of her seat. A quick dash through the rain and she would be home; it had been a long day. Rory too, is preparing himself for leaving the close shelter of the bus, for braving the dark and the rain awaiting outside.\\r\\nThis bus terminates here. The blonde girl stands before the bus comes to a stop, clutching the pole by the exit doors as she adjusts the weight of her handbag on her shoulder. The doors slide open with a hiss and the blonde girl hops down. He hears the loose tarmac of the bus bay crunch under her feet as she lands somewhere in the darkness beyond the doors.\\r\\nHe is mere seconds behind her, but he knows now that however quickly he follows her, she is always gone by the time he reaches the doors. He is left with nothing but the shadows in the bus station. Behind him the bus gives a shudder and the lights die. The driver, shift half over, hops down from the front entrance. Giving Rory a perfunctory nod, collar up against the rain, he stalks off in search of a warm drink in a polystyrene cup to see him through till dawn.\\r\\nRory’s feet are aching again. He turns down a cobbled mews road, the shortcut home, out of habit more than anything. It only saves about three minutes. He stops suddenly; the streetlights refracting over the tops of the buildings are playing tricks on him, conjuring up the light of a pale face, of blonde hair tossed over a shoulder. She stalks ahead of him, leading the way home; surely it is just the pattering of the rain that is drowning out her heels clicking against the cobbles?\\r\\nFor the sake of three minutes; for the sake of an empty purse – Emma never trusted herself with cash; for the sake of a few extra hours sleep on his part, she was left like a rag doll there in these narrow mews, the blood soaked deep into the darkness of her jacket but oh so red against the paleness of her skin, of her hair, of the suede bag she clutched so fiercely to her chest, even in death.\\r\\nRory walks on, following the lights. He always picked her up from the bus station after she finished a night shift, but that night he had been irritable, tired. He’d needed the sleep. And so now, that sleep denies him is a justice that he welcomes. And so night after night he walks the rainy streets, following the sheen of her hair in the dark.', 'The Night Bus by Erin Lawless', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '185-revision-v1', '', '', '2010-08-09 15:45:27', '2010-08-09 23:45:27', '', 185, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/185-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

He is left with nothing but the shadows in the bus station. Behind him the bus gives a shudder and the lights die. The driver, shift half over, hops down from the front entrance. Giving Rory a perfunctory nod, collar up against the rain, he stalks off in search of a warm drink in a polystyrene cup to see him through till dawn.\\r\\nRory’s feet are aching again. He turns down a cobbled mews road, the shortcut home, out of habit more than anything. It only saves about three minutes. He stops suddenly; the streetlights refracting over the tops of the buildings are playing tricks on him, conjuring up the light of a pale face, of blonde hair tossed over a shoulder.

He always picked her up from the bus station after she finished a night shift, but that night he had been irritable, tired. He’d needed the sleep. And so now, that sleep denies him is a justice that he welcomes.

The N333 is sat in the bay as he approaches, indicators flashing and doors closing as it goes to pull away. Rory hammers with the side of his fist on the damp red flank of the bus and, luckily, the driver pauses to let him on.\\r\\nIt is the older style of bus; the fabric on the seats is orange, shot through with geometrical shapes in a mustard yellow. The paint on the hold bar flecks off in his palm as he grabs the pole to steady himself as the bus jerks into the stream of traffic.  They always bring out the old fleet of buses for this nothing period of the night, where the only people likely to be traveling are too drunk or too tired to care about the damp smell and abrasive seating.\\r\\nRory swings off the hold bar into a seat towards the back, where he can feel the rumbling of the left rear wheel under his feet. He is just settling himself, wedging his knees against the seat in front, when the bus eases into its next stop and a girl gets on.\\r\\nShe presses her Oystercard holder to the reader and then twists to slip it into her handbag as she moves down the aisle of the bus. He cannot see her face, but her hair is straight and blonde, her figure trim in a short black jacket and jeans. Her fingers are long and thin, pianist fingers, with chipped pale pink nail varnish. She tosses her damp hair over her shoulder as she swings her bag into a seat, and slides in after it.\\r\\nThree rows ahead of him, she is hyper-real, each strand of hair haloed as the fluorescent tube bulb overhead picks up the droplets of rain clinging there. She fidgets - can she sense his eyes upon her? – and pulls her phone from her bag. The screen lights up as she flips the phone open and closed. No messages. She tosses her phone back into her bag and turns to face the window.\\r\\nHer face thrown back by the dark window is what Rory expected; she is pale and strong featured. The rain on the outside of the glass gouges across the reflection of her face in streaks as the bus hits a straight road and moves up a gear. The two sit in silence as the bus trundles on through sleeping London. If she does sense his attention, she makes no sign of it.\\r\\nThe bus slows once more, but passes the next stop without pausing when the driver sees no passengers waiting there. The blonde girl pulls her phone from her bag again, distractedly. No messages. Who was she expecting a text from at this time of night, Rory wonders.\\r\\nAnother stop, this time to let off a passenger who had been sitting on the upstairs deck. The drunken woman lurches off into the night, and the driver hesitates at his wheel as he peers into the darkness after her, willing her home safely. The blonde girl shifts restlessly in her seat; she is eager to get home herself and there are only a few stops left to travel.\\r\\nSlowly, slowly, the bus pulls away onto the road again.

Guy’s a dick thesaurus.”\\r\\nScalisi fumbled through his suit pocket and came up with a small notebook. He downed the rest of his now watery scotch on rocks, signaled the bartender with a gesture that was second nature. He found the page he needed. \\r\\n“Package,” he said. “Unit. Tool. Power Drill. Jack Hammer.”\\r\\n“Dick,” Morelli said.\\r\\n “Sure. Dick. Schlong. Weiner. Franfurter.”\\r\\n “Ok. Yeah. Jack-in-the-box.”\\r\\nScal considered it. It worked.\\r\\n“That’s a good one. You’re a quick learner. Not like that last guy I had. Believe you me. Caught a bullet in the skull not listening to what I had to teach him.”\\r\\nThe bartender placed a new drink on the bar. Took the spent tumbler. Knocked on the wood and walked away.\\r\\n Morrelli said, “Noodle. Magic wand.”\\r\\n “Ok. See? The snake. Mr. Johnson. I mean this Francisco knows ‘em all. He also knows I know he’s stalling, I got three of his fingers broke already. And I know this guy ain’t gonna roll over. He’s in a lose-lose. He gives up to me, Valantropo buries him. He doesn’t, I do. But it’s amusing. Fascinates the hell outta me, what a guy will say he’s under the gun. So I listen. Take notes. Hose. Magic wand. Joystick. Salamander. I’m thinking he ain’t gonna run out.”\\r\\n “Uh-huh. Sure.”\\r\\n“The Snake… But then he does run out. I see he''s thinking, but that''s it. I can tell. Just like that. Fresh out. And he says, ‘Well? don’t you get it?’”\\r\\n“Get what?”\\r\\n “That’s what I said. ‘Get what?’” Scalisi drank deeply.\\r\\n“Well?”\\r\\n“What’s in a name.”\\r\\n “What’s in a name?”\\r\\n “That''s what he says. ‘Same thing, whatsyou call it. But giving it so many names, makes a thing bigger than it is.’ See? Philosophizing, this guy. Says Americans got more fucking names for dicks than Eskimos got for snow.”\\r\\n“Huh.”\\r\\n“Yeah. And he asks me I think that means something about American Society? Lotsa dicks walking the streets, he means maybe. Least how I take it. Then he asks me, he says, I- me we’re talking about- he says I must feel pretty fucking special cause I got more names for me than the Eskimos got for snow and they’re buried in the shit.”\\r\\n“Meaning what exactly?”\\r\\n “Meaning he’s calling me a dick. Fancy-like.”\\r\\n Scalisi gave Morelli a few seconds for it to settle in.\\r\\n“That’s pretty good,” Morelli said.\\r\\n“Yeah, pretty good. I thought so.”\\r\\n “Whachyou do?”\\r\\n “Eh.

In the mornings, she dragged herself from a druggy sleep into the shower, where she let the very hot water stream over her naked lonely body. Later, she left for the city, her blonde hair swept into a forceful chignon and her heels high, but not vertiginous.\\r\\nAt the office Laurie spoke to the exact number of people necessary to fulfil her position''s requirements. This was less than two on any given day. As a book editor, her head was buried in manuscripts most of the time. Laurie rarely thought past the present day, as to look into the future would upset the very fine equilibrium she had alighted upon.\\r\\nWhen her husband had died from complications of a heart operation, at the age of thirty eight, Laurie was baffled by the event and decided not to go on. Nonetheless, she drove that body of hers on every day, because her parents were alive and his parents were alive, and everyone expected it of her. Everyone kept telling her at the funeral that she mustn’t let go, mustn’t give up after the awful\r\nransacking of her heart. Her aunt, her friends, her brother and the neighbours all told her;\\r\\n‘It would kill your mom and dad if anything happened to you.’\\r\\n‘It will kill Bob’s parents if you give up.’\\r\\n‘It will kill. It will kill…’\\r\\nEnvisioning the almost certain bloodbath guaranteed if she killed herself or just faded away from grief, Laurie pushed herself through every grinding moment of every adamant day.\\r\\nAt night, sitting with the cat and a stiff drink, she became an actuary; calculating the life span of all the people who needed to die before she too, could slip her moorings.\\r\\n<em>Marian Kilcoyne is an Irish writer published and forthcoming at Grey Sparrow Journal, The Smoking Poet, Camroc Press Review, Metazen, Frostwriting and Flashquake.</em>', 'A Plan For Laurie by Marian Kilcoyne', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '249-revision-3', '', '', '2011-03-01 11:35:40', '2011-03-01 19:35:40', '', 249, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/249-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(204, 1, '2020-06-18 09:31:38', '2020-06-18 17:31:38', 'From around a dense bramble choked bend, a lone swan emerged from dawn’s mist, dipping its head between reeds. ‘Where’s your mate?’ Fern asked. ‘Don’t swans stay with their partners until one of them dies?’ Tears stung at her own question. Behind her, from inside her car, the strains of the Flower Duet floated out to blend with amber hues and stagnant scents of early autumn. When they’d first met, James had encouraged her to listen to classical music. Took her to concerts. She, in turn, had introduced him to jazz.\r\n \r\nA cloud passed over the wavering sun, obliterating murky reflections at the canal’s edge but enhanced  four grey chimneys that stood belching out industrial smoke beyond waste ground. The swan floated closer. Damp and chilled, Fern shivered. Drew a musty blanket up around her shoulders. ‘On the river’s current.’ Fern’s voice sounded croaky as she accompanied the duet from her car’s CD. ‘One hand reaches, reaches  for the bank.’ She extended fingers towards the bird. ‘Ah, calling us together.’ She closed her eyes as the pure notes of two sopranos faded.\\r\\n‘Lakme committed suicide by eating a datura leaf,’ James had explained after a concert at the Albert Hall.\r\n \r\n‘How sad,’ she’d replied, hooking her arm into his. It had been her first concert and she’d hoped it wouldn’t be her last.\r\n \r\nNow Ella Fitzgerald sang, Every Time We Say Goodbye. If only James hadn’t stepped in front of her that night in the bar.

Spoken in a whisper, it sounded like Alpha, a promising beginning. But perhaps creation, once it has been opened with Alpha, can only be followed by silence.\\r\\nSitting in her chair on the porch she watched the empty parked cars. Frost scribbled on the windows and a small after-image froze: her fingers dangled in the air after she crossed herself three times. She often said to herself: I am the only one here.\\r\\nMuch earlier in her life (she had come over mountains and the ocean), she had seen rivers that looked like small streams, cities at night that flashed and were gone. Then she fell from above, and crashed, and ever since then she was in a flat country she never understood.\\r\\nShe would think to herself: It’s only when I’m sleeping that I never say “I’m dreaming.”\\r\\nThere were places out of time that all flowed into different corners of the halls. For instance, her husband Charles reading the Iliad in the yellow chair by the plastic potted ferns. Or a rubbed-out message in chalk that was blowing over the tire prints in the oval gravel drive.\\r\\nBut when she dreamed, she was always the same age she is now.\\r\\nWhen a hand appeared, a face, or a voice was heard from staff or visitors, everything changed: the black dog’s paws clicked across the porch, then came the tail eagerly slapping the floor: ear-dreams.\\r\\nOrpha on the porch, waving her arms, as if she were imitating the movements of the leaves,  or  saying goodbye to someone, or hailing one of the parked cars. She had angry, comprehending eyes. Palms up, she felt strong, and with her eyes closed she could believe the sunlight that settled upon her was warm fur. Those moments reminded her of nothing but: I AM.\\r\\nOnce, it streamed everywhere, and she was present, joined to one place. Those friendly and curious hands cupped the immense realm beyond the mountains: the edge of a continent. Death for once was all on the surface – the waves took it away. And she existed as skin, hunger, love: I AM, I AM. She smiled, but the eyes in her dream still looked angry. “Why am I here?” she asked herself. “Why am I here?” When she awoke, she was making motions with her fingers as if she were threading a needle.\\r\\n“Those jerks and jabs with her fingers mimic the speech of someone who stutters,” said the doctor examining her. “Was she a stutterer?”\\r\\n“The black dog knows,” she heard.\\r\\nNurse Jane was panting over her, her face contracted in one firm, set expression. She wanted to shout: “I know words. But do you? No, but you say you do. And that, dear Nurse Jane, that is the broken promise of speech: you think you are using words, but the words are using you.”\\r\\nThey carried her to a freshly made bed. It was a new room. Doctor’s orders. She heard him say the word change and out of his mouth chattered something like tumbling coins. (To whom had thoughts ever been so palpable?).\\r\\n“Put me out in the forest,” she wanted to say. “Lay me down among the sticks and the rotting leaves.“\\r\\nThe doctor: “Did she say something?”\\r\\nNurse Jane: “Orpha, did you say something?”\\r\\nI’m the log in the forest that will become the Savior. I’m the sculptor carving the log in the forest that will become the Savior. I’m the carpenter nailing the Savior to the post.\\r\\nThe wind made a sound like an animal squishing through wet leaves. Then the animal was gone, too.\\r\\nBut by and by the sliver of light under the door became a thin white bone. A drawer being opened was a short bark. The came the click of nails on the floor and the eager panting, panting, which in the ear-dream again became the ticking of the clock.\\r\\nTicking, ticking.\\r\\nAnguish.\\r\\nAnguish, passing from dark to dark and eyes lying in wait for the light.\\r\\nHer neighbor in the next bed was again busy counting, one thousand three, one thousand four, but this time Orpha’s pulse didn’t race to catch up. A single sound was repeated over and over – not a word, not yet a word, but something like “hmm?” blown through cupped hands.\\r\\nNurse Jane turning to her surprised, said: “If you don’t acknowledge this small miracle now, Orpha, you’ll be mute forever.”\\r\\n“Yes, yes, “ Orpha nodded, chomping on her teeth, as though the words, her first spoken words in ten years, didn’t really fit her right.\\r\\n“I want to say something that can be heard long after I’ve finished speaking,” said Orpha.\\r\\nNurse June clapped her hands. “Say it!

I remember looking up from Katy’s face as I worked away and the curtains were open. It was the middle of the day, a blue sky above and straight ahead I saw the cross atop a church steeple. I thought nothing of it at first. I carried on with Katy as she smiled up at me. Afterward, as she smoked a cigarette, I thought about Jesus up on that cross and all he had been through. I wondered if he was looking down on us as we lay there on the bed.\\r\\nI’m not particularly religious. My parents took me and my sister to church a few times a year, not including funerals, weddings, christenings. But they didn’t force it on me.\\r\\nThe next time, as she’s undoing her bra, I go over to the window and close the curtains.\\r\\n‘Worried someone might be watching,’ she said, letting the straps fall from her shoulders.\\r\\n‘Just in case,’ I said, joining her on the bed.\\r\\n‘But what if I want to be seen?’\\r\\n‘I don’t want anyone to know what we get up to in here,’ I said, pulling away as she reached out a hand towards my chest. She lay down with her back to me and we slept.\\r\\nI made sure the curtains were closed after that, but I still knew what was outside that window. Who was watching us, as the thorns scraped against His skull.\\r\\n‘What’s wrong with you?’ Katy said, as I lay on top of her, staring at the curtains.\\r\\nI shook my head and smiled, trying to put it out of my head and concentrate on the task at hand. But whenever I closed my eyes I saw Him looming over us.\\r\\nOne day, as Katy was over at her mother’s, I moved the bed. I turned it 90 degrees and pushed it over near the door. When I looked up all I would see was the faded blue wallpaper.\\r\\n‘What have you done in there,’ Katy said, when she got home.\\r\\n‘Thought I’d change things up a bit. Change of scenery,’ I said.\\r\\nShe shook her head. When we were in there later she straddled me, pinning my shoulders down. I looked up at the ceiling and thought about Him reaching down and tearing the roof off and shaking his head at us. I closed my eyes and let Katy carry on with what she was doing.\\r\\nAfter only a year we moved out. The office was moved to the city and we had some spare money for a bigger place. We looked at one apartment in this beautiful white building near the river. It was a great price and fully furnished too. In the bedroom I went to the window and could see a cross in the distance. We took this other place and furnished it ourselves. We’ve been here since and there’s no view at all, only the grey brick of the paper factory next door.\\r\\nI still think of the cross, the nails. It doesn’t stop me so much now. Over the years I’ve come to accept that he is everywhere, always watching us in the bedroom. I never told Katy about it all. I did not want to ruin it for her. We can just enjoy this for as long as it lasts.\\r\\n<em>More of James Turner''s short stories can be found on his <a href=\"http://www.bloodbonesbricks.co.uk/\">short story web site</a>.</em>', 'A Cross to Bear by James Turner', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'a-cross-to-bear-by-james-turner', '', '', '2020-06-23 11:04:03', '2020-06-23 19:04:03', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=234', 0, 'post', '', 3),

He was ambling alongside the road with a McDonald’s French fry box in his mouth, and something about those big sorrowful eyes, copper brown and pleading, tugged at my heart, and the steering wheel, forcing me to pull over and offer him a ride.\\r\\nThe scene was straight from a chic flick movie. I called out. He turned. He dropped the box and ran to me, his tongue outstretched, his tail wagging, rushing into my arms and delivering a big, slobbery kiss right on the lips. I was his heroine, his savior, and he gladly jumped into the truck and sat beside me as though we were destined to be together.\\r\\nThe stretch of road south of my home is flat and desolate, with acres of sandy fields running along White River. The area is a common dump site for the unwanted, and judging by the visible outline of his ribcage and sunken eyes, my new pet had seen better days. Raised around coon dogs, I knew the gangly creature to be a blue tick hound, probably about four or five months old. Bluish-black in color, with white spots, or ticking, spread over his body, he is an animated replica of one of my youngest son’s splotchy artworks hanging on the refrigerator. One ear and eye are completely black, giving him a half pirate, half Little Rascals comical appearance that makes him even more pitiful and endearing.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI call ahead to tell the kids we have a new member of the family, and they meet me at the truck with “ohhh”s, “ahhh”s, and “poor thing.” My 13-year-old feeds him a leftover hamburger from the fridge, while my 4-year-old offers French fries and hugs. I retrieve a bowl of water and a scoop of Purina from the house, and our scrawny friend happily gorges everything offered, burps, then laps up his water and licks the bowl. We stare in wonder at our appreciative guest, unaccustomed to company of any sort in our rural setting. The boys point at his bloated belly, which seems odd in comparison to his starved frame, and giggle. Our old Labrador, Buddy, watches from the porch, apprehensive and envious.\\r\\n“I like ‘im, Mommy,” Hunter announces. “He tol’ me ‘is name’s Charlie.” I rustle my son’s soft, strawberry-blonde hair, and Charlie licks him generously, perfectly content to be called anything as long as the food keeps coming. Full and more relaxed, the hound begins to investigate his new environment, sniffing around the yard, giving the cat a huge ‘Nice to meet ya’ lick, then relieving himself in the garden. I decide I like him more by the minute.\\r\\nThe boys coax Charlie into the house and give him a desperately needed bath, while I sit on the porch swing with a glass of iced tea and watch dusk surround our farm. Soon, they come bounding onto the porch, more wet and smelly than the dog, chattering like squirrels. I try to remember when I’ve seen them so excited and I enjoy the moment.\\r\\nCharlie jumps onto the swing and Josey and Briar follow. Hunter sits between my legs, enjoying a popsicle and offering Charlie an occasional lick. Our Labrador Buddy hobbles over and lays his head on my lap, and I pat my firstborn’s white fur and let him know he’s still the man of the house. The kids snuggle close and we watch the first star shimmer in the distance, and I can’t think of one thing to wish for.\\r\\n<em>Angie J.

She was so different from all the other grown-ups, with her wild grey hair caught up in a comb that never quite managed to capture those wayward curls.

In the mornings, she dragged herself from a druggy sleep into the shower, where she let the very hot water stream over her naked lonely body. Later, she left for the city, her blonde hair swept into a forceful chignon and her heels high, but not vertiginous.\\r\\nAt the office Laurie spoke to the exact number of people necessary to fulfil her position''s requirements. This was less than two on any given day. As a book editor, her head was buried in manuscripts most of the time. Laurie rarely thought past the present day, as to look into the future would upset the very fine equilibrium she had alighted upon.\\r\\nWhen her husband had died from complications of a heart operation, at the age of thirty eight, Laurie was baffled by the event and decided not to go on. Nonetheless, she drove that body of hers on every day, because her parents were alive and his parents were alive, and everyone expected it of her. Everyone kept telling her at the funeral that she mustn’t let go, mustn’t give up after the awful ransacking of her heart. Her aunt, her friends, her brother and the neighbours all told her;\\r\\n‘It would kill your mom and dad if anything happened to you.’\\r\\n‘It will kill Bob’s parents if you give up.’\\r\\n‘It will kill. It will kill…’\\r\\nEnvisioning the almost certain bloodbath guaranteed if she killed herself or just faded away from grief, Laurie pushed herself through every grinding moment of every adamant day.\\r\\nAt night, sitting with the cat and a stiff drink, she became an actuary; calculating the life span of all the people who needed to die before she too, could slip her moorings.\\r\\n<em>Marian Kilcoyne is an Irish writer published and forthcoming at Grey Sparrow Journal, The Smoking Poet, Camroc Press Review, Metazen, Frostwriting and Flashquake.</em>', 'A Plan For Laurie by Marian Kilcoyne', 0, '', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', 'a-plan-for-laurie-by-marian-kilcoyne', '', '', '2012-03-06 12:33:03', '2012-03-06 20:33:03', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=249', 0, 'post', '', 4),

It was an apt choice; most of the pieces were no more than a hundred words or so, beautiful, fragile little scenes that took a few seconds to read but stayed with you far, far longer. The idea was that the stories could fit, literally, in your palm. Typically Japanese.\\r\\nI, on the other hand, am not Japanese. And I''m far from fragile (but my mum thinks I''m beautiful. I hope.) When I first created this site, I was writing scenes and short stories filled with characters I remember from growing up in the suburbs of Manchester, in the north-west of England. You can read about some of them <a href=\"http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/but-why-the-man-by-martin-bell/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/doves-in-flight-by-martin-bell-2/\">here</a>.  Manchester is generally an industrial city (although I think it has changed some now) and my family were, and still are, working people. The people I met in the street, in the pubs, in the markets and especially those I came across as I followed my Dad around on his deliveries were more likely to show you the back of their hand (as in, “Any more lip from you son, an'' you''ll see the back o'' me hand!) than consider the merits of flash fiction crafted by a Japanese Nobel-prize-winning author.\\r\\nMost of the scenes I wrote never materialized into anything more substantial – in fact, most of them never materialized into anything at all, as they''re all still floating in the limbo of a corrupted hard drive at the bottom of a cardboard box on my garage floor. However, I did want to create a place for new writers where short fiction was the norm, where writers could grow and learn and where you could read  work in a couple of minutes that would stay with you the rest of the day.\\r\\nSo there you are.

If my father had given me due warning, I would never have agreed to bring his dogs to the funeral, but surprise had caught me off guard. Now they were patiently gnawing on my armrests as I scanned the row ahead of me for a parking spot. Letting no good deed go unpunished, the parking lot gods had already filled all the spots in the section closet to the funeral home.\\r\\nI stopped the car and sighed, then slowly lifted my hands off the steering wheel, reveling in the way my skin stuck to the hot leather. It was one of my few pleasures about summertime heat, the slow, almost painful separation that only happens after two objects have been forced together for a long while. I would always get the smallest bit scared in the final moments before the leather lost its grip on the last patch of skin. It was as if I was never sure if they would part; but they always did, and the soft snap of two surfaces being torn so smoothly from one another was the most satisfying aspect of the whole affair.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI let up on the brake and crept forward a few inches, looking around the back of a station wagon for a hidden parking spot. A disappointing small car filled the space next to it, partially hidden by the elongated back of its neighbor. I shot another glare at the dogs sitting behind me, blaming them for the lack of spaces. Reluctantly, I pulled up the length of empty cars and turned right, cruising past the rows that looked full. I considered calling Mom to tell her I would be late, but thought better of it when I remembered she was dead. Then, as if to fill the newly vacated position as head of the household, my sister called.\\r\\n“Where the hell are you? We’ve already started greeting people.”\\r\\n‘Cruising,’ I thought to myself; then answered, “I’m trying to find a parking space, the lot in front of the funeral home is full.”\\r\\nSilence greeted me on the other end of the line. It was typical of both my sister and mother to hang up once the information they needed was acquired. Etiquette did not rule them as it did me. I thought back to all the times where my mother would carefully avoid eye-contact with waiters, mechanics, retail employees, etc. ‘Service people,’ she called them. And I, with an M.S in history, giving tours at the American Museum of Natural History, was a ‘service people’ too. Not looking them in the eye was her way of asserting dominance, like a rhinoceros not making eye-contact with a tickbird to impress upon it it’s own insignificance, or a worm not looking at all the other worms because it’s a pretentious asshole.\\r\\nEither way, I was still late for the funeral and my sister was getting anxious.

He was just there and had to deal with it.\n<!--more-->\n\"Well, that''s fate,\" I said. \"Fate''s when things happen for a reason, despite what you do, despite what choices you make.\"\n\n\"Trust me, Father\" he said. \"If I''d made any choices in life, it wouldn''t have been standing here with you on a hot Wednesday afternoon, heaving around jugs of beer and a broom. Instead, I''d be... well, let''s just say I wouldn''t be here.\n\n\"And if I was you, I''d be careful who I started talking about fate with. Aren''t you all supposed to put it down to what the big fella wants? Or are you one of those young modern priests who doesn''t actually believe in God?\"\n\nHe said \"modern\" as if it was a swearword. I''m sure that if it weren''t his bar he would have spat on the floor as he said it. But instead he looked back from the TV to the bar floor and carried on sweeping.\n\nI suppose it could have been a miracle that the girl had been found. The only reason anyone had been in the alley was because a main had burst, forcing showers of water out onto the street in front of the bar. A crew had gone back behind Charlie''s with a backhoe to dig up the street, and they''d been down there about half-an-hour when a valve went, forcing them to shut the digger off. And that was when the foreman heard the gurglings of the baby.\n\nNow, don''t get me wrong, I''m certain in my faith. Well. I think I am. But I just can''t believe in a God who would put an innocent thing like that in such danger in the first place, at least for no reason. I''ve got to ask more of my God than that. My God is good.\n\nHe''s treated me well. There aren''t many other priests my age with a parish this size. Sure, I have a few problems here and there, but really, I''ve got nothing to complain about. Well, I didn''t until today. And now look at me.\n\nSo I sat at the bar and watched the TV flicker from the nurse to the water company foreman, a small dark-skinned man wearing a helmet a couple of sizes too big. They''d filmed him in the alley, and he was pointing from the big trench he''d dug, then over to Charlie''s back door. The camera followed his finger, as if a hole in the ground and a dirty door could explain the absurdity of a six-week old girl being left in an alleyway behind a dive bar.\n\nThen the story was done, and the anchor started talking about something else.\n\nI tilted my glass back, felt the foamy dregs hit the top of my lips, then placed the glass back on the bar, fitting the circle of the glass exactly within the edges of the round paper coaster. I like to do that. It reassures me when everything fits. And it''s important to me that people have their idiosyncrasies; probably why I felt so comfortable with Charlie, even if most the time he''s moaning about the bar. You know, he never says goodbye. Ever. He once told me, on one of the occasions when we managed to have a real conversation, that he hates to think of never seeing people again. He can''t bear that final goodbye, the thought that that moment could be the last time he ever saw someone. If he doesn''t acknowledge their exit, then to him they never really left. Which is a little bit weird, but it makes me like him. I don''t know why.\n\nAnd as I left, Charlie was rubbing his broom across the dirty floor in the far corner, trying his best to ignore me.\n\nWhich doesn''t really go to explain what I''m doing, six hours later, telling you about Sheila. But I have to start somewhere.\n\nAfter Charlie''s I went about my usual Wednesday, checking on Mrs. Hemingway at the corner, making sure that the dealers lurching around in front of the boarded-up store window weren''t giving her any trouble. They weren''t, for a change, even though a couple glared at me as I walked in. They don''t like me, and I don''t blame them. Not sure I liked them too much either. I certainly don''t now. I don''t think they see me as the priest. I mean, I''m not your typical small town Father am I? I''m not much older than they are. They''re used to a little old man they can pretend to respect. Someone they can say good morning to while they''re selling vials to kids. And that''s what they had until I got here. Well, that''s not me.\n\nWhen I asked Mrs. Hemingway, she said she was okay like she always did, even though the stress of owning the store could be seen running rivulets of worry across her face, carving deeper lines every time I saw her. She gave me a box of Tic-Tacs, the green ones that I liked to carry in the breast pocket of my coat, and asked God to bless me. Then I ducked out the door and crossed the street to the diner.\n\nAt that time of day, hours from lunch but not close enough to dinner, there''s never any problem getting my spot, the booth right in the middle of the restaurant directly overlooking Mrs. Hemingway''s store. As I tidied up my knife and fork, placing them equidistantly on the place mat, parallel to the table edge with my water glass directly above the knife, I looked over at the group across the street. They looked back. We played this game. I''d stare at them, and they''d stare at me. Nothing usually happened. Just games.\n\nSheila was serving coffee to Riley at the counter. I heard they had a thing once, but now their conversation was strained. She was scared of him. Most people in town are. They say he''s the reason the kids are there outside the store everyday, that they work for him. But it''s only talk, so he still gets away with acting like a normal citizen, still comes in for coffee everyday, usually at the same time as me. We barely say more than a \"hey\" to each other. He''s a big man, big both ways, with dirty hairy knuckles that swallow his coffee cup, and curly sideburns that never quite become a full beard. I can''t imagine the badness he''d done to Sheila. I think she''d been resigned to it.\n\nShe turned to grab the water jug, and walked from behind the counter to my booth. She has a gentle walk, a smooth way of putting one foot in front of the other that leaves her long face traveling along a single line in space. Makes me think of what she could have been if she''d had her chance, if men like Riley hadn''t taken her choices from her.\n\nAnd that was when the madness really started. With that walk. With me and Sheila. With me not thinking.\n\nShe started to pour the water, leaning over my table. \"Hear about that baby they found, Father?\" she asked, not quite managing a smile. Her eyes looked tired.\n\n\"Yes, I did Sheila. Nasty business.\" I looked at her face, lingered on her warm brown breasts that nestled in the open neck of her shirt, then down to my glass. I knew she knew I looked. I think she felt sorry for me, couldn''t understand why a good looking man like myself would have ever wanted to choose to renounce sex. So I think she allowed me a quick peek for the same reasons I take disabled kids to theme parks, to give them a snatch of something different, to make them feel as if they were living a normal life. And she''s right, of course.\n\n\"And how are you? He''s not bothering you is he?\" I nodded upwards at Riley.\n\n\"Him? God no.\" she glanced back at the counter and lowered her voice. \"But there is something I need to talk to you about. I was waiting for you to come in.\"\n\n\"What is it? Sit down, tell me,\" I said, pointing to the space opposite.\n\n\"I can''t now. It''s something I can''t tell you here. Give me ten minutes and I''ll meet you at my car out front. It''s the red Camaro,\" she said.\n\nThen she walked her walk back to Riley, who was looking agitatedly at his empty cup.\n\nSheila had often asked me advice before, and I was pleased to give it. Youngish, good-looking women don''t often sit for any length of time with priests, I''m sure you know that, and I was glad of the company. And, I have to admit, I looked forward to spending time with her. Even with her problems, she''s good company. And she''s very easy on the eye. It''s got to the point where I see her just about everyday; usually when I drop into the diner in the afternoon just before her shift ends or we sometimes run into each other at Charlie''s.\n\nWe typically talk about some man or another, or her landlord, or an argument with her sister. Sometimes I think she exaggerates her problems just so she can talk to me, because they''re often easily solved. I just sit with her a while, give her options and lead her to pick the right one. Or sometimes we just talk. But this was different. We usually speak in public where anyone can hear us. There isn''t anything odd in a priest giving a parishioner advice, even if I do look at her a little too closely.\n\nI took a sip of ice water, placed the glass square on the coaster and stood up.\n\n\"Not eatin'' today Father?\" Riley''s snippy voice cut across the diner. He must have known there was something up. I never come in then leave.\n\n\"No. No, not. Um, feeling too well.\" I was always bad at lying.\n\n\"Well you better run off home then, Father.\"\n\n\"Yes. I think I will.\"\n\n\"See ya then.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I''ll see you later.\" He was only trying to make it worse for me. I wondered if he was the problem Sheila wanted to talk to me about. I hoped not.\n\nSheila''s car was parked over to the right of the lot, an old red Camaro, like she said, with dents and rust and dirty smears over its windscreen. The sort of car you''d expect a waitress to drive. I leant on the passenger side door while I waited, eyeing the dealers across the road. They were there again and again, day after day, the same five kids just standing, looking angry, swapping stares with me. They knew we were playing a game as much as I did, but they enjoyed it a lot more. I thought about what was going through their minds, if they ever got bored, if they felt it was worth it, if they were ever scared, like I was.\n\nShe came out of the diner almost running, defiling the gracefulness of her walk with an awkward shuffle, and motioned with her head to the car.\n\n\"Get in. It''s open.\"\n\nI pulled open the door and slid inside.\n\nShe drove us out, past the strip mall, past the last gas station for forty miles, out into the plain where the road disappears in the haze, then turned and parked behind a billboard for a new housing development. It was getting hotter, one of those strange days when the heat suddenly kicks up a notch around four, and I could feel moisture begin to drip from my forehead. But I think I would have been sweating anyway.\n\nThe silence was wrong. There are usually other people around us when we meet, and to be alone together was disjointed, uncomfortable. I wanted to tell her that she was in a safe place, that I''d protect her whatever her problem, but I couldn''t. I sat there looking out into the open space like a pimply teenager on a date, wringing my fingers. And I could tell that she was struggling as much as I was, because she couldn''t look my way. Just hard silence between us. The seconds ticked away to the sound of popping metal, as some parts of the car cooled while others warmed in the sun.\n\nEventually she spoke.\n\n\"I''m sorry I brought you out here, Father.\"\n\nIt was a relief to hear her voice.\n\n\"That''s OK, Sheila. Tell me what''s on your mind,\" I said.\n\n\"It doesn''t matter. You can''t help. Don''t worry. I''ll just take you back to town. Forget about it.\" She went to turn the key in the ignition, and I leaned over to hold her hand still, to pull the key back.\n\nNow we were close. \"There is obviously something troubling you.\" I said, my face no more than six inches away from her nose. My hand remained on hers. \"You didn''t bring me all this way for something unimportant. Let me help you. Let me know what''s wrong.\"\n\n\"I''m sorry.\" she said, her green-brown eyes finally pinned on mine. \"I was wrong to ask you here. You don''t need to get involved in this. It could be bad for us. I mean, you.\"\n\nI removed my hand and sat back in the seat. A breeze gusted through the open window, and it felt good, fresh.\n\nI spoke without looking at her, ''Sheila, you have to remember that this is what I do. that I''m here to help you. It doesn''t matter how I feel, or what happens to me.\"\n\nI didn''t believe what I was saying either.\n\n\"So just let me know what you brought me out here for.\" It could have been someone else speaking.\n\n\"I was pregnant Father.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said, still not looking back at her. \"What happened?\"\n\nShe turned.\n\n\"I got rid of it.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" A dribble of moisture fell across my forehead, working it''s way down my nose. I wiped my eyes with my sleeve. More silence swept through the car, as I put my broken thoughts together. The heat was getting unbearable.\n\n\"Are you OK? I mean, that''s what''s important. How are you?\" We were looking directly at each other now, across the seat divider, across the gearshift.\n\nA tear formed slowly in the cusp of her eye, a tiny bubble of pain beading against the thick mascara. \"I thought I was OK, that I''d manage. Then there was that little girl who was found. It brought it all back. I couldn''t sleep last night, I was laying in bed, sweating, thinking about what I did, about how the girl could have been mine, about how she''d be starting to walk now, how I''d be looking after her, feeding her, buying her clothes, making her pretty.\" her voice broke down into a dark cloud of sobs.\n\nI put my arm over her back, brought her close to me. Her soft hair caressed my chin, which I rested on the top of her head. She shook with tears.\n\n\"What''s done is done.\" I said, staring out into the plain.\n\nI was searching for guidance, for someone or something - the emptiness of the countryside, the far off blank horizon, the baked yellow grass yearning for a breeze - anything that wasn''t in the car to give me permission to fall into her, to drown myself in her warm hair, her slight body, her gentle breaths.\n\nBut I was lost. There was the rational part of me, the part that gets me through my life, the un-thinking right and wrong black and white good and bad just do it machine that wanted to be able to give her the same advice I''d give to anyone else, and then leave, let her deal with her own problems. Help with loving detachment. But I was there, holding her in the hot car, feeling the part of me that really makes me who I am, the part that supports my faith and informs my wonder, the parts that supplies my awe - the real God''s honest man - I was feeling that part of me trickling through my thoughts, just like my blood, and I realized how much I cared for her. How much I wanted her not to hurt. How much I really wanted her.\n\nShe cried some more, and spoke into my chest.\n\n\"I felt so worthless. So pathetic. So evil. I knew what that poor girl was going through when she left the baby there. How frightened she must have been, how terrified I was. How terrified I still am. And I lay there in my shitty little apartment, alone on my big bed as the walls just loomed in on me knowing that it can''t happen again, that I don''t want to be alone. That I need someone, someone good.\"\n\nShe drew away from me a little, her arms remaining close on mine, her eyes pinning me down in the seat.\n\n\"I don''t want to be alone, Father. Ever. I can''t stand another night like that again. I can''t go through my days trying to make the best of it, putting up, making do. Taking shit from assholes like Riley. I need someone. I need you. I''m in love with you, Father.\"\n\nEven though I knew what she was going to say, even though I wanted her to say it, the words still hit me hard. But I''m glad she said it first.\n\n\"We all need someone to love.\" I said. The words came out like a whisper in the dark.\n\nThe internal battle still rang through my body. I didn''t know what to say to her. Of course I wanted to tell her my truth, to let her know how much I wanted her, but I had so much to lose.\n\n\"You know that the Church is my life,\" I told her. \"I''ve made a commitment... I''d lose everything I''ve worked for. Everything I believe in. You know I care about you. And if things were different, if I''d made different choices. But...\"\n\nShe pushed her face into my neck. I could feel the tears cool against my skin, mingling with my sweat. My face remained staring out of the windscreen, as if I was another person.\n\n\"Some choices are too important to be thought about\" she said.\n\nMinutes stretched by, and I tried not to think, tried to clear my mind. Then I kissed the top of her head, keeping my face in her hair. She pulled away, and looked up, and our lips touched. Slowly.\n\nAnd slowly we sat there, and sat there, and kissed. And it was good.\n\nShe drove us back to town as the sun was falling. The buildings were glowing in golden shadows, darkness chasing light out into the street. We didn''t speak, and she left me in the diner parking lot, where we started. I was alone.\n\nThe dealers were in their roost, leaning and spitting and swearing. They saw me, and we stood together and apart, me watching them watching me, as the sun sank lower behind the diner, as I wondered what I was, as I struggled to move, as I struggled to leave.\n\nWatching, thinking, waiting for what would happen next.\n\nThen I stepped off the curb.\n\nThe first dealer''s punch hit me on my left temple, and I managed to ride it, but his second one smashed my chin and left me dazed. Then another hit me again and then kicked me, and I went down, and then all five of them were there, kicking and kicking and kicking and laughing and snorting with exertion. Then they left me and it grew dark.\n\nI woke again to the neon lights from Mrs. Hemingway''s store flickering over my blood on the sidewalk. Somehow I managed to stand and limp back to the church.\n\nAnd that''s when I found you here, Father, and asked you to hear my confession. I am here, and I confess. I have sinned.\n', 'Not Waving Goodbye, Saying Hello by Martin Bell', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '6-autosave-v1', '', '', '2011-04-12 10:00:09', '2011-04-12 18:00:09', '', 6, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/6-autosave/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Forget about it.\" She went to turn the key in the ignition, and I leaned over to hold her hand still, to pull the key back.\\r\\nNow we were close. \"There is obviously something troubling you.\" I said, my face no more than six inches away from her nose. My hand remained on hers. \"You didn''t bring me all this way for something unimportant. Let me help you. Let me know what''s wrong.\"\\r\\n\"I''m sorry.\" she said, her green-brown eyes finally pinned on mine. \"I was wrong to ask you here. You don''t need to get involved in this. It could be bad for us. I mean, you.\"\\r\\nI removed my hand and sat back in the seat. A breeze gusted through the open window, and it felt good, fresh.\\r\\nI spoke without looking at her, ''Sheila, you have to remember that this is what I do. that I''m here to help you. It doesn''t matter how I feel, or what happens to me.\"\\r\\nI didn''t believe what I was saying either.\\r\\n\"So just let me know what you brought me out here for.\" It could have been someone else speaking.\\r\\n\"I was pregnant Father.\"\\r\\n\"I see,\" I said, still not looking back at her. \"What happened?\"\\r\\nShe turned.\\r\\n\"I got rid of it.\"\\r\\n\"Oh.\" A dribble of moisture fell across my forehead, working it''s way down my nose. I wiped my eyes with my sleeve. More silence swept through the car, as I put my broken thoughts together. The heat was getting unbearable.\r\n\"Are you OK? I mean, that''s what''s important. How are you?\" We were looking directly at each other now, across the seat divider, across the gearshift.\\r\\nA tear formed slowly in the cusp of her eye, a tiny bubble of pain beading against the thick mascara. \"I thought I was OK, that I''d manage. Then there was that little girl who was found. It brought it all back. I couldn''t sleep last night, I was laying in bed, sweating, thinking about what I did, about how the girl could have been mine, about how she''d be starting to walk now, how I''d be looking after her, feeding her, buying her clothes, making her pretty.\" her voice broke down into a dark cloud of sobs.\\r\\nI put my arm over her back, brought her close to me. Her soft hair caressed my chin, which I rested on the top of her head. She shook with tears.\\r\\n\"What''s done is done.\" I said, staring out into the plain.\\r\\nI was searching for guidance, for someone or something - the emptiness of the countryside, the far off blank horizon, the baked yellow grass yearning for a breeze - anything that wasn''t in the car to give me permission to fall into her, to drown myself in her warm hair, her slight body, her gentle breaths.\\r\\nBut I was lost. There was the rational part of me, the part that gets me through my life, the un-thinking right and wrong black and white good and bad just do it machine that wanted to be able to give her the same advice I''d give to anyone else, and then leave, let her deal with her own problems. Help with loving detachment. But I was there, holding her in the hot car, feeling the part of me that really makes me who I am, the part that supports my faith and informs my wonder, the parts that supplies my awe - the real God''s honest man - I was feeling that part of me trickling through my thoughts, just like my blood, and I realized how much I cared for her. How much I wanted her not to hurt. How much I really wanted her.\\r\\nShe cried some more, and spoke into my chest.\\r\\n\"I felt so worthless. so pathetic.so evil. I knew what that poor girl was going through when she left the baby there. How frightened she must have been, how terrified I was. How terrified I still am. And I lay there in my shitty little apartment, alone on my big bed as the walls just loomed in on me knowing that it can''t happen again, that I don''t want to be alone. That I need someone, someone good.\"\\r\\nShe drew away from me a little, her arms remaining close on mine, her eyes pinning me down in the seat.\\r\\n\"I don''t want to be alone, Father. Ever. I can''t stand another night like that again. I can''t go through my days trying to make the best of it, putting up, making do. Taking shit from assholes like Riley. I need someone. I need you. I''m in love with you, Father.\"\\r\\nEven though I knew what she was going to say, even though I wanted her to say it, the words still hit me hard. But I''m glad she said it first.\\r\\n\"We all need someone to love.\" I said. The words came out like a whisper in the dark.\\r\\nThe internal battle still rang through my body. I didn''t know what to say to her. Of course I wanted to tell her my truth, to let her know how much I wanted her, but I had so much to lose.\\r\\n\"You know that the Church is my life,\" I told her. \"I''ve made a commitment... I''d lose everything I''ve worked for. Everything I believe in. You know I care about you. And if things were different, if I''d made different choices. but.\"\\r\\nShe pushed her face into my neck. I could feel the tears cool against my skin, mingling with my sweat. My face remained staring out of the windscreen, as if I was another person.\\r\\n\"Some choices are too important to be thought about,\" she said.\\r\\nMinutes stretched by, and I tried not to think, tried to clear my mind. Then I kissed the top of her head, keeping my face in her hair. She pulled away, and looked up, and our lips touched. Slowly.\\r\\nAnd slowly we sat there, and sat there, and kissed. And it was good.\\r\\nShe drove us back to town as the sun was falling. The buildings were glowing in golden shadows, darkness chasing light out into the street. We didn''t speak, and she left me in the diner parking lot, where we started. I was alone.\\r\\nThe dealers were in their roost, leaning and spitting and swearing. They saw me, and we stood together and apart, me watching them watching me, as the sun sank lower behind the diner, as I wondered what I was, as I struggled to move, as I struggled to leave.\\r\\nWatching, thinking, waiting for what would happen next.\\r\\nThen I stepped off the curb.\\r\\nThe first dealer''s punch hit me on my left temple, and I managed to ride it, but his second one smashed my chin and left me dazed. Then another hit me again and then kicked me, and I went down, and then all five of them were there, kicking and kicking and kicking and laughing and snorting with exertion. Then they left me and it grew dark.\\r\\nI woke again to the neon lights from Mrs. Hemingway''s store flickering over my blood on the sidewalk. Somehow I managed to stand and limp back to the church.\\r\\nAnd that''s when I found you here, Father, and asked you to hear my confession. I am here, and I confess. I have sinned.\r\n', 'Not Waving Goodbye, Saying Hello by Martin Bell', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '6-revision-v1', '', '', '2008-02-02 16:42:23', '2008-02-03 00:42:23', '', 6, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/6-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(276, 1, '2020-07-02 13:31:22', '2020-07-02 21:31:22', 'I hated my funeral. Everyone was all sad and quiet. Dad was like a statue. Mom was the opposite. She wouldn’t stop moving and there were tissues everywhere. She had on a dress with no sleeves so she couldn’t stick Kleenex up her sleeves like she usually does. And it was hot. I’m dead and even I was sweaty.\\r\\nSarah didn’t look up the whole time. But that was normal for her. It was either that or her giant brown eyes staring at me all evil-like. That’s the only way she looked at me when I was alive. I kind of deserved it though. I liked to pick on her a lot. One time I threw all her stuffed animals out the window. She walked in after I threw the last one down.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n“What are you doing in my room?” She had just gotten a haircut and had huge bangs on her forehead. She looked stupid.\\r\\n“You look stupid.” \\r\\nShe smoothed her hair down over and over. “You’re stupid.” Then she noticed what was missing. “Where are my stuffed animals?”\\r\\nI stuck my hands in my pockets. “I dunno.” \\r\\nShe ran to the window and looked down and screamed. I laughed so hard, but then she hit me right in the face and made me cry. Mom ran into the room then and yelled at Sarah, which made me feel better. But then she found out what I did.\\r\\n“Daniel, you’re getting too old for these games. This isn’t how seven year olds act, is it?” \\r\\n“Yeah huh.”\\r\\nShe made me go down and pick up all the animals. I was so mad I hid one of them in the bushes. I didn’t hide her favorite one though. The stupid pink rabbit. She would have hit me really hard if I did. She hasn’t even found the hidden one yet. I wonder if she even notices it’s gone. I wonder if she even notices I’m gone.\\r\\nBenny said it’s the law to pick on your big sister. He’s my best friend. Or I guess he was. He’ll probably get a new one now.\\r\\nBenny has two big sisters. That’s two times worse than having just one. All of them were at my funeral. One of them is really pretty though. Maria. Even her name is pretty in my mouth: Maria Morgan. She had black stuff running down her face at my funeral. I felt bad for making her cry.\\r\\nBenny said boys are never ever supposed to cry. But I saw him break that rule a couple days ago. He doesn’t know though. He’ll never know. I was being James Bond. That’s what I call my spying since I’m dead and can’t ever be caught.\\r\\nIt was the night after we went swimming. He was eating dinner with his family but none of them really touched their food at all. Maria wasn’t at dinner cause I would’ve spied on her instead. I don’t know where she was. Probably with the boy Benny and I caught her all tangled up with one time. She’d screamed like someone cut her.\\r\\nBenny’s parents were talking to him real slowly. But I couldn’t hear what they were saying cause there weren’t any windows open. I pressed my ear so hard against the glass it hurt. I wanted to punch it like they do in the movies. But then the next thing I knew I was in the Morgan’s kitchen. That was the night I found out I didn’t have to use doors anymore.\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Morgan are real funny. Mr. Morgan acts like a clown all the time. He told me he was one in College. I think that’s the next town over. Mrs. Morgan is always real smiley and jumps around a lot. Mom said she is a walking fiesta, but not in a nice way.\\r\\nThat night they weren’t acting funny and smiley though. They were telling Benny how lucky he was to be sitting there right then. I wouldn’t say that though cause their chairs are so hard and straight. They told him that it could have been him instead of me. But he went swimming too so I guess they meant dying. I wish Benny were here. He would love spying all the time.\\r\\nI left after that. I got sad cause spying without a partner in crime is not real fun at all. James Bond must have been real lonely.\\r\\nBenny didn’t cry at my funeral too much. I thought I saw some tears fall but he wiped them real quick. His other sister Claudia kept taking her glasses off and blowing her nose. I don’t even know why she was so sad. I never talked to her cause one time she tried to kiss me on the mouth and I ran away so fast. I wished Benny had timed me cause it would have broken my record but he didn’t even know. I never told him or anybody. I don’t really like to talk about it. Except now sometimes I wish I’d let her cause I died without ever being kissed by a girl.\\r\\nI came really close one time with Heather Waters. We got locked in the coat closet at school. Heather has the longest hair I ever saw and it’s the color of squirrels.\\r\\n“You can touch it if you want.” She pulled it around so it fell over her arm like the curtains at our Thanksgiving play. I ran my hand over it. It was so soft.\\r\\n“I got this new shampoo that makes it soft as silk.” \\r\\n“Why don’t you cut it and make it a blanket or something?” She pulled her hair back so hard.\\r\\n“I will never ever cut my hair, Daniel Thompson, and don’t you ever ask me that again.” I liked how she had said that. It was like her very own Superman cape. Then I just plain asked her if I could kiss her.\\r\\n“Can I kiss you?” \\r\\nShe didn’t answer for a real long time. But then she nodded, and as soon as I took a step toward her Ms. Aarons unlocked the door.\\r\\nI’m going to miss Ms. Aarons. She looked like happiness. She had bright yellow hair and bright white teeth. I liked her so much it almost hurt to be near her. I was the only one in the first grade who hated leaving when school ended. She didn’t look happy at my funeral though. Her hair looked like Ms. Frizzle’s from the Magic School Bus. And she was with some guy who kept his arm around her. I didn’t like the looks of him, so I stayed away.\\r\\nThere were some people I didn’t even know there. Some were dad’s friends from work that I met like one time in my whole life. They must have really liked me, I guess.\\r\\nOne time I asked mom if dad liked me. She was making me waffles, which is my favorite food ever, and got all sad and concerned. She crouched down next to me like she was putting a band-aid on my knee or something.\\r\\n“Why would you ask something like that, Daniel?”\\r\\n“I dunno. When someone likes you they talk to you and play with you. He doesn’t do that. Are my waffles ready?” \\r\\n“Daniel, your father loves you. He’s just has a different way of showing it. Sarah loves you, and she shows you by letting you use the bathroom first in the morning right?” \r\n “I guess so. But you show me the most so you must love me the most right?” She hugged me real big then.\\r\\n“Your daddy and I love you the exact same. Always remember that, okay?”\\r\\n“Okay. But my waffles are burning.” She had to make me another batch.\\r\\nDad acted different after that. He used to always be real quiet. Everything around him was quiet too. It was like something would break if you made a noise. But then he started asking me to play catch all the time and threw me like a torpedo in our pool. It was the best week ever. But then I died.\\r\\nBenny and I just wanted to go swimming. We have a pool in our backyard and we swum in it all the time during the day. But we had never swum in it at night before and we wanted to know what it was like, that’s all. I knew it would make mom mad cause she hates it when I scare her. I used to do it all the time when I was real little. I would run inside screaming, “There’s a wolf in the backyard, there’s a wolf in the backyard!” Cause Benny had just told me the story about the boy who cried wolf. But I knew I wouldn’t get eaten like the boy cause there aren’t any wolves in South Carolina.\\r\\nThe first time I yelled it, they fell for it. Dad jumped out of his chair so fast it flew behind him like he farted. Mom screamed. I laughed so hard but then mom put soap in my mouth. I shut up after that. Soap is gross. It’s like giving your mouth a bath.\\r\\nWhen Benny and I went swimming, I just thought that if mom found out she’d put soap in my mouth again. I could live through another mouth washing. I definitely didn’t think it would be my last swim ever.\\r\\nBenny and I tried so hard not to laugh when we were taking off our pajamas. I remember I got goose bumps real bad when the wind blew. I should have known right then not to go swimming. It was a bad omen. Like dad says when the sky’s red in the morning or when I walked under a ladder that one time. I never really got that though cause it sounds like what we say at church after a prayer, and prayers are good things.\\r\\nI was usually a real good swimmer. But my leg started hurting and got all tight when I was in the deep end. I remember looking up at the moon through my goggles. It was so big that night. It looked like a giant white pancake. All I kept thinking when I started swallowing water was that I really wanted some waffles.\\r\\nMom probably won’t miss making them for me though. I would ask for them every morning. Dad and Sarah never ate them. Dad just drank coffee. Now that I’m gone that’s the only thing I’ve seen go into his belly.\\r\\nAnother weird thing that’s happened since I’ve gone is that he sleeps on the couch now. Dad always said couches were for sitting not for sleeping. He should get soap in his mouth for breaking a rule.\\r\\nMom is the weirdest though. She barely even talks. I almost forget what her voice sounds like. And her laugh. I loved making her laugh. It always reminded me of Christmas morning. At least she says good night to me still even though she sounds different. Her voice is all heavy. But every night wherever I am I can hear her whisper: “Good night, Daniel. See you with the sun.”\\r\\nShe’s said that to me every night since I can remember. It was the only way I’d stay in bed when I was real little. She would tell me that I couldn’t get up without the sun. I used to stare at the moon so hard with my death ray vision but it never moved or exploded. That would have been real cool. But mom said it only moved when I had my eyes closed. She was right too cause the next time I opened my eyes the moon would always be gone.\\r\\nAfter I died, the first thing I did was run up to my parent’s room. Mom opened her eyes as soon as I walked in. I thought for a second she could see me. She got out of bed real slow. Her blankets hardly moved and the dent in her pillow didn’t even rise. Everything was so still and quiet. I felt like we were in a snow globe that had never been shook before. Then she heard Benny yelling my name.\\r\\nMom sprinted downstairs. I could barely keep up with her. Her feet slapped against the floors so loud, it sounded like someone was clapping.\\r\\nShe threw open the back door and was at the pool in three giant leaps and kept running right into the water. She pulled my old body out onto the edge of the pool and started pushing real hard on my chest. Then she listened to it. I put my hand on my new chest. Nothing.\\r\\nMom kept pushing on my chest. I felt bad cause she was soaking wet in her pajamas. And also cause Benny was making noises and rocking with his face in his knees on the other side of the pool.\\r\\nI opened my mouth to tell them both to stop, but then mom made the worst noise I ever heard in my life. It sounded like a wolf was eating her. The wolf I used to tease her about. That sound was worse than dying.\\r\\n<p align=\"center\">******</p>\\r\\nIt’s a month after my funeral now.

Then he goes in the bathroom for a shower.\\r\\nI lie down next to mom and prop myself up on my elbow. I look at her face a long time. Sunlight starts coming in through the windows. She opens her eyes.\\r\\nI whisper, “Good morning, mom. I’m here with the sun.”\\r\\nShe goes downstairs and makes waffles.

(278, 1, '2011-04-19 13:45:16', '2011-04-19 21:45:16', 'I hated my funeral. Everyone was all sad and quiet. Dad was like a statue. Mom was the opposite. She wouldn’t stop moving and there were tissues everywhere. She had on a dress with no sleeves so she couldn’t stick Kleenex up her sleeves like she usually does. And it was hot. I’m dead and even I was sweaty.\n\nSarah didn’t look up the whole time. But that was normal for her. It was either that or her giant brown eyes staring at me all evil-like. That’s the only way she looked at me when I was alive. I kind of deserved it though. I liked to pick on her a lot. One time I threw all her stuffed animals out the window. She walked in after I threw the last one down.\n<!--more-->\n“What are you doing in my room?” She had just gotten a haircut and had huge bangs on her forehead. She looked stupid.\n\n“You look stupid.” \n\nShe smoothed her hair down over and over. “You’re stupid.” Then she noticed what was missing. “Where are my stuffed animals?”\n\nI stuck my hands in my pockets. “I dunno.” \n\nShe ran to the window and looked down and screamed. I laughed so hard, but then she hit me right in the face and made me cry. Mom ran into the room then and yelled at Sarah, which made me feel better. But then she found out what I did.\n\n“Daniel, you’re getting too old for these games. This isn’t how seven year olds act, is it?” \n\n“Yeah huh.”\n\nShe made me go down and pick up all the animals. I was so mad I hid one of them in the bushes. I didn’t hide her favorite one though. The stupid pink rabbit. She would have hit me really hard if I did. She hasn’t even found the hidden one yet. I wonder if she even notices it’s gone. I wonder if she even notices I’m gone.\n\nBenny said it’s the law to pick on your big sister. He’s my best friend. Or I guess he was. He’ll probably get a new one now.\n\nBenny has two big sisters. That’s two times worse than having just one. All of them were at my funeral. One of them is really pretty though. Maria. Even her name is pretty in my mouth: Maria Morgan. She had black stuff running down her face at my funeral. I felt bad for making her cry.\n\nBenny said boys are never ever supposed to cry. But I saw him break that rule a couple days ago. He doesn’t know though. He’ll never know. I was being James Bond. That’s what I call my spying since I’m dead and can’t ever be caught.\n\nIt was the night after we went swimming. He was eating dinner with his family but none of them really touched their food at all. Maria wasn’t at dinner cause I would’ve spied on her instead. I don’t know where she was. Probably with the boy Benny and I caught her all tangled up with one time. She’d screamed like someone cut her.\n\nBenny’s parents were talking to him real slowly. But I couldn’t hear what they were saying cause there weren’t any windows open. I pressed my ear so hard against the glass it hurt. I wanted to punch it like they do in the movies. But then the next thing I knew I was in the Morgan’s kitchen. That was the night I found out I didn’t have to use doors anymore.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Morgan are real funny. Mr. Morgan acts like a clown all the time. He told me he was one in College. I think that’s the next town over. Mrs. Morgan is always real smiley and jumps around a lot. Mom said she is a walking fiesta, but not in a nice way.\n\nThat night they weren’t acting funny and smiley though. They were telling Benny how lucky he was to be sitting there right then. I wouldn’t say that though cause their chairs are so hard and straight. They told him that it could have been him instead of me. But he went swimming too so I guess they meant dying. I wish Benny were here. He would love spying all the time.\n\nI left after that. I got sad cause spying without a partner in crime is not real fun at all. James Bond must have been real lonely.\n\nBenny didn’t cry at my funeral too much. I thought I saw some tears fall but he wiped them real quick. His other sister Claudia kept taking her glasses off and blowing her nose. I don’t even know why she was so sad. I never talked to her cause one time she tried to kiss me on the mouth and I ran away so fast. I wished Benny had timed me cause it would have broken my record but he didn’t even know. I never told him or anybody. I don’t really like to talk about it. Except now sometimes I wish I’d let her cause I died without ever being kissed by a girl.\n\nI came really close one time with Heather Waters. We got locked in the coat closet at school. Heather has the longest hair I ever saw and it’s the color of squirrels.\n\n“You can touch it if you want.” She pulled it around so it fell over her arm like the curtains at our Thanksgiving play. I ran my hand over it. It was so soft.\n\n“I got this new shampoo that makes it soft as silk.” \n\n“Why don’t you cut it and make it a blanket or something?” She pulled her hair back so hard.\n\n“I will never ever cut my hair, Daniel Thompson, and don’t you ever ask me that again.” I liked how she had said that. It was like her very own Superman cape. Then I just plain asked her if I could kiss her.\n\n“Can I kiss you?” \n\nShe didn’t answer for a real long time. But then she nodded, and as soon as I took a step toward her Ms. Aarons unlocked the door.\n\nI’m going to miss Ms. Aarons. She looked like happiness. She had bright yellow hair and bright white teeth. I liked her so much it almost hurt to be near her. I was the only one in the first grade who hated leaving when school ended. She didn’t look happy at my funeral though. Her hair looked like Ms. Frizzle’s from the Magic School Bus. And she was with some guy who kept his arm around her. I didn’t like the looks of him, so I stayed away.\n\nThere were some people I didn’t even know there. Some were dad’s friends from work that I met like one time in my whole life. They must have really liked me, I guess.\n\nOne time I asked mom if dad liked me. She was making me waffles, which is my favorite food ever, and got all sad and concerned. She crouched down next to me like she was putting a band-aid on my knee or something.\n\n“Why would you ask something like that, Daniel?”\n\n“I dunno. When someone likes you they talk to you and play with you. He doesn’t do that. Are my waffles ready?” \n\n“Daniel, your father loves you. He’s just has a different way of showing it. Sarah loves you, and she shows you by letting you use the bathroom first in the morning right?” \n “I guess so. But you show me the most so you must love me the most right?” She hugged me real big then.\n\n“Your daddy and I love you the exact same. Always remember that, okay?”\n\n“Okay. But my waffles are burning.” She had to make me another batch.\n\nDad acted different after that. He used to always be real quiet. Everything around him was quiet too. It was like something would break if you made a noise. But then he started asking me to play catch all the time and threw me like a torpedo in our pool. It was the best week ever. But then I died.\n\nBenny and I just wanted to go swimming. We have a pool in our backyard and we swum in it all the time during the day. But we had never swum in it at night before and we wanted to know what it was like, that’s all. I knew it would make mom mad cause she hates it when I scare her. I used to do it all the time when I was real little. I would run inside screaming, “There’s a wolf in the backyard, there’s a wolf in the backyard!” Cause Benny had just told me the story about the boy who cried wolf. But I knew I wouldn’t get eaten like the boy cause there aren’t any wolves in South Carolina.\n\nThe first time I yelled it, they fell for it. Dad jumped out of his chair so fast it flew behind him like he farted. Mom screamed. I laughed so hard but then mom put soap in my mouth. I shut up after that. Soap is gross. It’s like giving your mouth a bath.\n\nWhen Benny and I went swimming, I just thought that if mom found out she’d put soap in my mouth again. I could live through another mouth washing. I definitely didn’t think it would be my last swim ever.\n\nBenny and I tried so hard not to laugh when we were taking off our pajamas. I remember I got goose bumps real bad when the wind blew. I should have known right then not to go swimming. It was a bad omen. Like dad says when the sky’s red in the morning or when I walked under a ladder that one time. I never really got that though cause it sounds like what we say at church after a prayer, and prayers are good things.\n\nI was usually a real good swimmer. But my leg started hurting and got all tight when I was in the deep end. I remember looking up at the moon through my goggles. It was so big that night. It looked like a giant white pancake. All I kept thinking when I started swallowing water was that I really wanted some waffles.\n\nMom probably won’t miss making them for me though. I would ask for them every morning. Dad and Sarah never ate them. Dad just drank coffee. Now that I’m gone that’s the only thing I’ve seen go into his belly.\n\nAnother weird thing that’s happened since I’ve gone is that he sleeps on the couch now. Dad always said couches were for sitting not for sleeping. He should get soap in his mouth for breaking a rule.\n\nMom is the weirdest though. She barely even talks. I almost forget what her voice sounds like. And her laugh. I loved making her laugh. It always reminded me of Christmas morning. At least she says good night to me still even though she sounds different. Her voice is all heavy. But every night wherever I am I can hear her whisper: “Good night, Daniel. See you with the sun.”\n\nShe’s said that to me every night since I can remember. It was the only way I’d stay in bed when I was real little. She would tell me that I couldn’t get up without the sun. I used to stare at the moon so hard with my death ray vision but it never moved or exploded. That would have been real cool. But mom said it only moved when I had my eyes closed. She was right too cause the next time I opened my eyes the moon would always be gone.\n\nAfter I died, the first thing I did was run up to my parent’s room. Mom opened her eyes as soon as I walked in. I thought for a second she could see me. She got out of bed real slow. Her blankets hardly moved and the dent in her pillow didn’t even rise. Everything was so still and quiet. I felt like we were in a snow globe that had never been shook before. Then she heard Benny yelling my name.\n\nMom sprinted downstairs.

It sounded like a wolf was eating her. The wolf I used to tease her about. That sound was worse than dying.\n\n<p align=\"center\">------</p>\n\nIt’sa month after my funeral now. Mom’s still in bed when there is a knock on the door. Dad pops his head in.\n\nMom’s eyes are closed and she doesn’t move. Dad comes in and kisses her forehead real soft like a whisper. Then he goes in the bathroom for a shower.\n\nI lie down next to mom and prop myself up on my elbow. I look at her face a long time. Sunlight starts coming in through the windows. She opens her eyes.\n\nI whisper, “Good morning, mom. I’m here with the sun.”\n\nShe goes downstairs and makes waffles.

Petty, but true. Should I end with ''sincerely'', a nasty little spike to the addressee''s heart? Oh, yes, I''m SO sincere in spitting on your twisted little face. I hate you. YOURS SINCERELY... Perhaps not. I should at least try for politeness, for civility, right? I don''t know what last shred of manners held me back. Social convention, maybe. I don''t believe in that normally.\\r\\nTwo women, one man, the old story. And I won. I was low enough to send my victory, farewell missive by email, not even in person. I didn''t care, after everything she had put me through, I was happy to do it. So many women would hate me, hell, so many men would hate me. Everyone would judge me who didn''t know the situation if I just stated it, but I don''t care. I know what happened.\\r\\nI remember the looks she gave me when she realised he preferred me. He would speak to me with a smile and she would snipe at him, as she had done for years, now, her ugly face twisted up with hate and patronising spite. Before, he would wince and apologise to her and hang his head; she would smirk in victory over the weakling man. After he started paying his attention to me, he brushed her off. I could make his face light up. I knew it, and that made me happy. He deserved it; he had nothing but pain from her.\\r\\nWhen he said he was moving out of their house, moving in with me, she screamed and hired lawyers and private detectives and burned his clothes, but he was too glad to be free. He said, calmly, he''d pay her whatever settlement she wanted and that detectives meant nothing. They petered out after that. She emailed me evil poison-letters and threatened to track down our new house and set fire to it. I told her if she carried on like that, I''d report her to the police. She fell more silent after that, at least.\\r\\nI care for him and love him like she could not. I look after him and cook our favourite meals. I can do what she was meant to do so much better than she ever could. We shop together and everyone smiles, to see a happy pair as us out and about. Those who know her give us sympathetic smiles; those who don''t just think we''re a normal pair in such a situation, out in the sunshine. I like that. I feel more normal that way. I hated feeling like a freak for the way I felt about her, for taking him away, and at such a young age, too. Only 16. People say I''m mature for my age – I think this has made me so.

They turned white, sharpened as winds lifted them and the sky continued to darken and roil. A summer shower was coming on fast. I watched the women run off the field. Mothers shouted for their children. Car headlights came on, thunder cracked, and rain with a whoosh drenched everything.\\r\\n All was about to change. It started raining friends. It started raining mothers.

We had known each other for eight years, since we first poked fun at each other on the playgrounds of first grade, and here she was, telling it like it is.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\"You could tear out all the hair on your head, rip all the freckles off your face and arms, and stomp on them until they''re a twisted, matted mess, and you couldn''t understand.\"\\r\\nI lay there with her, both of us entombed together in our momentary creation, and was all too aware of my silence. I couldn''t help it; there was nothing in my short life that had prepared me to react to the situation at hand, nothing to compare to this, and I could think of nothing to say. We lay, watching the slow drift of carefree clouds across the pale blue sky, watching the partially clothed trees as they lazily shed another article of disguise. These were the days of ending, of fading and letting go; these were the days of release, and she was releasing everything into the air of our temporary refuge.\\r\\n\"It''s not fair,\" she said bluntly, the words stinging the air like the bitter breeze when it kicked up and whipped our faces. \"It''s not fair.\"\\r\\n\"I know,\" I whispered softly, unsure and at a loss as to what else to say. \"I know, and I''m sorry.\" I immediately felt stupid, selfish saying that, out of touch and ashamed, but I was helpless to the situation. I felt helpless and hopeless, cold inside in a way that had nothing to do with the encroaching end of the year.\\r\\n\"It''s like -\" she started, and trailed off. \"Like everything you ever wanted...\"\\r\\nWe slipped into an endless silence, and I knew she was crying. She was my best friend, had been my only best friend, had lived down the street and around the corner from me for as long as I could remember. We had wandered through the paths in our neighborhood, explored the massive woods nearby in comfortable silence, but this was by far the worst. Everything now felt hollow, empty. The days of running and laughing through the wide open fields, of sitting on swings and staring up at the stars, of getting muddy and hunting for frogs in Three-Mile Creek, they felt so far away from this decaying pile of plant matter that we had made our sanctuary.\\r\\nShe sniffed back a tear and I reached for her arm, the only warmth amongst the crackling red and orange and gold. \"I''m sorry,\" I whispered again. I wanted to fill the chill air with words and comfort and reassurance, anything, but nothing would come. My hand slid down her arm and came to rest in hers, and we lay there, soaking in the bony skeletons of the birch and oak that blotted the sky.\\r\\n\"It''s not real,\" she said - \"it can''t be real. It was never supposed to come to this.\" We laid there immersed in our silence, at a loss for words, for two hours as the sun sank low, vacillating back and forth between disbelief and silence. What it is and what could have been. Dry eyes and tears.\\r\\n\"Hey Meg!\" her father called eventually from the front porch. \"Why don''t you come on inside?\"\\r\\n\"Coming!\" she called, and turned to me. She looked me up and down, covered in leaves, and laughed. \"You look ridiculous!\" she said, burying me in the rest of the pile and rolling out into the grass. We stood up, brushing leaves from our clothes, and I offered a tentative smile. \"I''ll see ya tomorrow, Meg,\" I said uncertainly.\\r\\n\"She grabbed me and pulled me in close. \"Of course, Tommy,\" she said happily. \"See you tomorrow.\"\\r\\n-\\r\\nThe next day, she was gone. I came home from school and burst through our front door, calling \"Hey Mom!\" over my shoulder as I raced my younger brother to the top of the stairs. Skidding into my room to unpack my bag, the ringing of the phone reverberated throughout the house. Faintly, I heard my mother answer, and continued throwing my books onto my bed. I had just changed my shirt and was searching for where I flung my shoes when the knock came at my door.\\r\\n\"Tommy?\" she said, opening it slightly, and before she said anything else, I knew. A coldness swept through me as I jammed my foot into my shoe and pushed past my mother, ignoring her calls, and sprinted out the door. Hitting the cold asphalt of the road, I raced toward the corner with a growing, internal plea of \"no no no no no no no\" careening around my head, each word keeping pace with my steps. Reaching the corner I hurtled onto the next street, gaining steam and running flat out, disregarding the pain in my stomach and legs. I reached number 23 Hemlock Street in what must have been a record time and stopped in the driveway, catching my breath. The house sat empty, shorn of life, and I stared back at it, unbelieving. Everything dropped out of me and I nearly fell, staggering sideways into the yard.\\r\\nI was in a fog, my thoughts consumed by the faltering refrain in my head. It was with a jolt that I reached the pile of leaves, slightly disfigured by the Autumn wind, but with two distinct imprints marking their territory. Two distinct outlines the size of two idealistic kids. Two reserved spaces with only one body to fill them both.\\r\\nSlowly, I lowered myself into my perfectly molded, red, orange and gold chamber. There was no sun today as I looked up from our beautifully crafted safe haven, just grey skies and freezing temperatures. It was November 19th, the coldest day of the year so far, and the last leaves from the birch and oak above me were slowly, one by one, detaching themselves from the safety of their branches and letting go, twirling gently toward their final repose.\\r\\nThe days were fading, the year was ending, the trees were letting go and, lying right here, I thought, she had had her release. I hadn''t said a word of meaning, had laid right next to her and soaked it all in while we watched the sun sink and the trees give it all up, and she had, I hoped, had her release. We laid there in silence and soaked in the Autumn, soaking in the best friendship, soaking in the years and the memories and the conversations and then, before anyone could help it, she was gone.\\r\\nHot tears rolled down my face as I laid in our carefully plotted hideaway, destined to remain only half-full for as long as it lasted. The day, again, was ending and I laid, again, in a helpless silence. As I stared through the naked branches above, in our frozen, brittle fortress of leaves, it began, softly at first, then gaining steam, to snow.\\r\\nI sat up, watching the decaying red, the dying orange, the fading gold, turn gradually to white. Standing, I turned once more to number 23 Hemlock Street, glanced once more at the blank windows of the living room I knew so well, and surveyed for the last time the carefully raked pile of leaves, occupancy two, the biggest pile on the street, as the two noticeable indentations filled gradually with white. Gradually transformed to something new. Fading, but still a clear reminder.\\r\\nThe year was ending, but not everything was gone forever.\\r\\n<em>Dan Rys is a 22-year-old writer/journalist from Syracuse new York now living in Boston, MA.

We had known each other for eight years, since we first poked fun at each other on the playgrounds of first grade, and here she was, telling it like it is.\\r\\n\"You could tear out all the hair on your head, rip all the freckles off your face and arms, and stomp on them until they''re a twisted, matted mess, and you couldn''t understand.\"\\r\\nI lay there with her, both of us entombed together in our momentary creation, and was all too aware of my silence. I couldn''t help it; there was nothing in my short life that had prepared me to react to the situation at hand, nothing to compare to this, and I could think of nothing to say. We lay, watching the slow drift of carefree clouds across the pale blue sky, watching the partially clothed trees as they lazily shed another article of disguise. These were the days of ending, of fading and letting go; these were the days of release, and she was releasing everything into the air of our temporary refuge.\\r\\n\"It''s not fair,\" she said bluntly, the words stinging the air like the bitter breeze when it kicked up and whipped our faces. \"It''s not fair.\"\\r\\n\"I know,\" I whispered softly, unsure and at a loss as to what else to say. \"I know, and I''m sorry.\" I immediately felt stupid, selfish saying that, out of touch and ashamed, but I was helpless to the situation. I felt helpless and hopeless, cold inside in a way that had nothing to do with the encroaching end of the year.\\r\\n\"It''s like -\" she started, and trailed off. \"Like everything you ever wanted...\"\\r\\nWe slipped into an endless silence, and I knew she was crying. She was my best friend, had been my only best friend, had lived down the street and around the corner from me for as long as I could remember. We had wandered through the paths in our neighborhood, explored the massive woods nearby in comfortable silence, but this was by far the worst. Everything now felt hollow, empty. The days of running and laughing through the wide open fields, of sitting on swings and staring up at the stars, of getting muddy and hunting for frogs in Three-Mile Creek, they felt so far away from this decaying pile of plant matter that we had made our sanctuary.\\r\\nShe sniffed back a tear and I reached for her arm, the only warmth amongst the crackling red and orange and gold. \"I''m sorry,\" I whispered again. I wanted to fill the chill air with words and comfort and reassurance, anything, but nothing would come. My hand slid down her arm and came to rest in hers, and we lay there, soaking in the bony skeletons of the birch and oak that blotted the sky.\\r\\n\"It''s not real,\" she said - \"it can''t be real. It was never supposed to come to this.\" We laid there immersed in our silence, at a loss for words, for two hours as the sun sank low, vacillating back and forth between disbelief and silence. What it is and what could have been. Dry eyes and tears.\\r\\n\"Hey Meg!\" her father called eventually from the front porch. \"Why don''t you come on inside?\"\\r\\n\"Coming!\" she called, and turned to me. She looked me up and down, covered in leaves, and laughed. \"You look ridiculous!\" she said, burying me in the rest of the pile and rolling out into the grass. We stood up, brushing leaves from our clothes, and I offered a tentative smile. \"I''ll see ya tomorrow, Meg,\" I said uncertainly.\\r\\n\"She grabbed me and pulled me in close. \"Of course, Tommy,\" she said happily. \"See you tomorrow.\"\\r\\n-\\r\\nThe next day, she was gone. I came home from school and burst through our front door, calling \"Hey Mom!\" over my shoulder as I raced my younger brother to the top of the stairs. Skidding into my room to unpack my bag, the ringing of the phone reverberated throughout the house. Faintly, I heard my mother answer, and continued throwing my books onto my bed. I had just changed my shirt and was searching for where I flung my shoes when the knock came at my door.\\r\\n\"Tommy?\" she said, opening it slightly, and before she said anything else, I knew. A coldness swept through me as I jammed my foot into my shoe and pushed past my mother, ignoring her calls, and sprinted out the door. Hitting the cold asphalt of the road, I raced toward the corner with a growing, internal plea of \"no no no no no no no\" careening around my head, each word keeping pace with my steps. Reaching the corner I hurtled onto the next street, gaining steam and running flat out, disregarding the pain in my stomach and legs. I reached number 23 Hemlock Street in what must have been a record time and stopped in the driveway, catching my breath. The house sat empty, shorn of life, and I stared back at it, unbelieving. Everything dropped out of me and I nearly fell, staggering sideways into the yard.\\r\\nI was in a fog, my thoughts consumed by the faltering refrain in my head. It was with a jolt that I reached the pile of leaves, slightly disfigured by the Autumn wind, but with two distinct imprints marking their territory. Two distinct outlines the size of two idealistic kids. Two reserved spaces with only one body to fill them both.\\r\\nSlowly, I lowered myself into my perfectly molded, red, orange and gold chamber. There was no sun today as I looked up from our beautifully crafted safe haven, just grey skies and freezing temperatures. It was November 19th, the coldest day of the year so far, and the last leaves from the birch and oak above me were slowly, one by one, detaching themselves from the safety of their branches and letting go, twirling gently toward their final repose.\\r\\nThe days were fading, the year was ending, the trees were letting go and, lying right here, I thought, she had had her release. I hadn''t said a word of meaning, had laid right next to her and soaked it all in while we watched the sun sink and the trees give it all up, and she had, I hoped, had her release. We laid there in silence and soaked in the Autumn, soaking in the best friendship, soaking in the years and the memories and the conversations and then, before anyone could help it, she was gone.\\r\\nHot tears rolled down my face as I laid in our carefully plotted hideaway, destined to remain only half-full for as long as it lasted. The day, again, was ending and I laid, again, in a helpless silence. As I stared through the naked branches above, in our frozen, brittle fortress of leaves, it began, softly at first, then gaining steam, to snow.\\r\\nI sat up, watching the decaying red, the dying orange, the fading gold, turn gradually to white. Standing, I turned once more to number 23 Hemlock Street, glanced once more at the blank windows of the living room I knew so well, and surveyed for the last time the carefully raked pile of leaves, occupancy two, the biggest pile on the street, as the two noticeable indentations filled gradually with white.

We lay, watching the slow drift of carefree clouds across the pale blue sky, watching the partially clothed trees as they lazily shed another article of disguise. These were the days of ending, of fading and letting go; these were the days of release, and she was releasing everything into the air of our temporary refuge.\\r\\n\"It''s not fair,\" she said bluntly, the words stinging the air like the bitter breeze when it kicked up and whipped our faces. \"It''s not fair.\"\\r\\n\"I know,\" I whispered softly, unsure and at a loss as to what else to say. \"I know, and I''m sorry.\" I immediately felt stupid, selfish saying that, out of touch and ashamed, but I was helpless to the situation.

She was my best friend, had been my only best friend, had lived down the street and around the corner from me for as long as I could remember. We had wandered through the paths in our neighborhood, explored the massive woods nearby in comfortable silence, but this was by far the worst. Everything now felt hollow, empty. The days of running and laughing through the wide open fields, of sitting on swings and staring up at the stars, of getting muddy and hunting for frogs in Three-Mile Creek, they felt so far away from this decaying pile of plant matter that we had made our sanctuary.\\r\\nShe sniffed back a tear and I reached for her arm, the only warmth amongst the crackling red and orange and gold. \"I''m sorry,\" I whispered again. I wanted to fill the chill air with words and comfort and reassurance, anything, but nothing would come. My hand slid down her arm and came to rest in hers, and we lay there, soaking in the bony skeletons of the birch and oak that blotted the sky.\\r\\n\"It''s not real,\" she said - \"it can''t be real. It was never supposed to come to this.\" We laid there immersed in our silence, at a loss for words, for two hours as the sun sank low, vacillating back and forth between disbelief and silence. What it is and what could have been. Dry eyes and tears.\\r\\n\"Hey Meg!\" her father called eventually from the front porch. \"Why don''t you come on inside?\"\\r\\n\"Coming!\" she called, and turned to me. She looked me up and down, covered in leaves, and laughed. \"You look ridiculous!\" she said, burying me in the rest of the pile and rolling out into the grass. We stood up, brushing leaves from our clothes, and I offered a tentative smile. \"I''ll see ya tomorrow, Meg,\" I said uncertainly.\\r\\n\"She grabbed me and pulled me in close. \"Of course, Tommy,\" she said happily. \"See you tomorrow.\"\\r\\n-\\r\\nThe next day, she was gone. I came home from school and burst through our front door, calling \"Hey Mom!\" over my shoulder as I raced my younger brother to the top of the stairs. Skidding into my room to unpack my bag, the ringing of the phone reverberated throughout the house. Faintly, I heard my mother answer, and continued throwing my books onto my bed. I had just changed my shirt and was searching for where I flung my shoes when the knock came at my door.\\r\\n\"Tommy?\" she said, opening it slightly, and before she said anything else, I knew. A coldness swept through me as I jammed my foot into my shoe and pushed past my mother, ignoring her calls, and sprinted out the door. Hitting the cold asphalt of the road, I raced toward the corner with a growing, internal plea of \"no no no no no no no\" careening around my head, each word keeping pace with my steps. Reaching the corner I hurtled onto the next street, gaining steam and running flat out, disregarding the pain in my stomach and legs. I reached number 23 Hemlock Street in what must have been a record time and stopped in the driveway, catching my breath. The house sat empty, shorn of life, and I stared back at it, unbelieving. Everything dropped out of me and I nearly fell, staggering sideways into the yard.\\r\\nI was in a fog, my thoughts consumed by the faltering refrain in my head. It was with a jolt that I reached the pile of leaves, slightly disfigured by the Autumn wind, but with two distinct imprints marking their territory. Two distinct outlines the size of two idealistic kids. Two reserved spaces with only one body to fill them both.\\r\\nSlowly, I lowered myself into my perfectly molded, red, orange and gold chamber. There was no sun today as I looked up from our beautifully crafted safe haven, just grey skies and freezing temperatures. It was November 19th, the coldest day of the year so far, and the last leaves from the birch and oak above me were slowly, one by one, detaching themselves from the safety of their branches and letting go, twirling gently toward their final repose.\\r\\nThe days were fading, the year was ending, the trees were letting go and, lying right here, I thought, she had had her release. I hadn''t said a word of meaning, had laid right next to her and soaked it all in while we watched the sun sink and the trees give it all up, and she had, I hoped, had her release. We laid there in silence and soaked in the Autumn, soaking in the best friendship, soaking in the years and the memories and the conversations and then, before anyone could help it, she was gone.\\r\\nHot tears rolled down my face as I laid in our carefully plotted hideaway, destined to remain only half-full for as long as it lasted. The day, again, was ending and I laid, again, in a helpless silence. As I stared through the naked branches above, in our frozen, brittle fortress of leaves, it began, softly at first, then gaining steam, to snow.\\r\\nI sat up, watching the decaying red, the dying orange, the fading gold, turn gradually to white. Standing, I turned once more to number 23 Hemlock Street, glanced once more at the blank windows of the living room I knew so well, and surveyed for the last time the carefully raked pile of leaves, occupancy two, the biggest pile on the street, as the two noticeable indentations filled gradually with white.

He stayed isolated from the group, working the harder jobs along the trim steel, hauling wires and jumping rails, as if he dared God to let him slip. When the boys ate their lunches hundreds of feet above the solid concrete, he drank from a small silver flask, the only sustenance we ever saw him ingest. But that man, alone atop the blaring city, rivaled the memory of Hercules.\\r\\nWatching him work, you could image him beating raw ore into form. A brute who a thousand years ago would have been hailed a God, only to be the grunt, the fat ant doling out his life. Knowing him made me scoff at TV; boxing, bare knuckle, even famed blood sports paled in comparison.\\r\\nOne night with my wife I sat eating quietly in a diner adjacent to a club notorious simply for the patrons who frequented. Out of the blue He came, flask peaking out of his jeans. His eyes took sight of the club and he gave a roar, his body launching him through the door. Gunshots fired, quickly overpowered by the sound of fists packing meat into the floor. I watched as minutes later he poured out of the door, his chest slipping blood from entry holes, his fist still gripped tight to one man’s neck.\\r\\nHe spent the next at work free falling from one railing level to another. Some starred in wonder, question why any man would tempt death so much.\\r\\nWhy wonder, I say.\\r\\nHe was a gladiator at his prime, hauling metal. A small child had better education than this titan. None had right to judge.\\r\\nMen who claimed him a degenerate stared in awe when his fists swung, both exhilarated and demeaned, for the could never match up.\\r\\nWomen who recoiled in disgust lived in a fantasy at the quiet hour, a world where his arms wrapped tight around them and their breath left in ecstasy.\\r\\nFor 25 years I knew him, without ever knowing him. At 45 he had a heart attack at the 20th floor of a building and fell. The concrete spilt beneath the impact of his incredible mass. Ribs cracked, bones shattered, and still he attempted to rise only to spit blood.

The type of shoes that gave her blisters on the heels of her feet that hindered her ability to walk distances longer than five minutes. Then again, she hadn’t planned on wandering around, speaking to nothing. Her nose was running from the tears, but instead of reaching into her pocket and pulling out the Kleenex she had brought, she wiped it on the shoulder of her sleeve. Screw personal hygiene.\\r\\nIt was hot and humid out, not the keenest day to be outdoors. The smart, would be inside their air-conditioned houses sipping lemonade, watching comedy Wednesdays on TV. Instead, Lanie searched.\\r\\n“It has to be here. It has to.” She whispered, exhausted. “It just has to be.” She checked the next headstone. ‘DORNBUSH’ it read. She was beginning to think the person she was looking for didn’t exist. She had to exist. She’d visited this place enough times to know where it was. They don’t just unbury bodies and replant them elsewhere! A new set of tears brimmed her eyelids, and another choking cry escaped. She didn’t care who was watching, it was a graveyard, for cripes sake. Crying was okay, it was practically mandatory.\\r\\nShe was lost. She’d covered the same length of distance at least three times, and still nothing. “This is where it was, this is the area you always were. I remember. I remember seeing you. Why can’t this just be easy.” Something in her life had to be right, had to be easy. Everything she seemed to do of late was horrible, or disapproving. Lanie needed to find her. She was the one person in this world who couldn’t judge her, or yell at her, or tell her she was a screw up. All things Lanie already knew. She just needed silence. Lanie figured in a graveyard, she could easily achieve that. But not any gravestone would do, she couldn’t just hunker down beside the Greenes, or the Temelltons, it needed to be her. It needed to be.\\r\\n“I didn’t come here to search for you! I came here to be with you!” She sniffled. “Just send me a sign! Show me where I’m supposed to go!” She collapsed herself against a tree and shrivelled down to sitting position. Drawing her knees to her chest, she wrapped her arms around, tucking them beneath her chin. She looked around, helpless. She didn’t come here to feel helpless. She felt this already, this emptiness. Nothing went as planned. She came here to relax, to let go, to cry. Not the tears of being lost, but tears to release all this anger she’d bottled inside her.\\r\\nSafety. That’s what Lanie came here for. She wanted to feel safe, for once. She needed to feel the burdens she carried, be lifted, if only for a few moments. It was so much more, she came for so much more. She needed a place, where she could be herself. A place where she could unwind, after a stressful day, and just be the person she was trying so desperately to become. Whoever that was.\\r\\nFinding herself was something Lanie needed to do, and with all these people breathing down her neck, she found it nearly impossible to do so. She was falling apart, piece by piece, she could feel it. They were telling her she was wrong, she was immature, easily pressured, incompetent, untrusting. She was tired of it. Tired of being judged, and constantly watched. She had to cover her tracks, be careful, and watch herself. It became more and more like a fulltime job and she had grown emotionally haggard.\\r\\nShe pulled her music player out, and plugged it into her ears to drown out the silence that had suddenly started to scream at her. She closed her eyes and leaned her head back to rest on the tree trunk. She inhaled deeply, and released a shaky breath.\\r\\nMusic was supposed to sooth her, it was supposed to heal her. She could feel her throat close up, and the welling of tears began. Fighting them back, she swallowed them down. She would not cry anymore, she could not.\\r\\nShe pulled the ear buds forcefully from her ears. The silence had turned deafening, and music could not protect her. Thoughts of her family gushed into her mind. She had let them down, again. She had let her friends down; she probably had even let herself down. Living up to people’s standards was exhausting, and time consuming.\\r\\nLanie pushed herself up from the ground and resumed talking to herself and the silence she needed to escape\\r\\n“I didn’t know you. I never even met you. They tell me I met you, and I was happy with you. But I was a baby, and I don’t remember. You were there for everyone else before me, why couldn’t you be there for me?” Tears rolled down her cheeks in an unsynchronized rhythm. “I need you now, and you’re not here. You’re supposed to be here, right here, I remember. I’ve visited you. Why aren’t you where I remember! You can be here for me, I need you to be here for me now.” She wiped at her nose with the backside of her hand. “Please,” she barely whispered. “Please be here. Let me find you.”\\r\\nIn the midst of her outburst, Lanie had ambled over the gravel path to another patch of headstones. She stopped, looking about her, she sighed. Looking down, she saw it. The name, carved perfectly in the sunken headstone. She fell on all fours and pressed her hand to the name. “Thank you.” She sobbed. “Thank you so much.”\\r\\nHer tears were no longer of anger, and abandonment, but of happiness, and a sense of accomplishment. She had scoured this place, for something that wasn’t where she had thought it was. She had felt as lost here, as she did in her own life. She’d felt helpless, in a place where all she wanted to feel was hope, and a sense of security.\\r\\nMaybe the search for the headstone was what Lanie needed. She needed to look where she shouldn’t, in order to open her eyes. To see something about her life that she hadn’t been able to see till now. She was looking for happiness, and solitude in her life in all the wrong places. She needed to look elsewhere, to family, to friends, to the people she knew were doing everything she despised, just to help her. The lady beneath the headstone had helped her in her path to self-discovery before Lanie had even found her.\\r\\n“I found you,” Lanie breathed. Perhaps in addition to, she’d just found a ray of hope for herself.\\r\\nRolling over to fall on her back, Lanie smiled. For the first time that evening, she smiled. An uncontrollable laughter erupted from her lungs, and she could feel the pieces of her shattered life start to make their way back to each other. Her healing had begun.

The type of shoes that gave her blisters on the heels of her feet that hindered her ability to walk distances longer than five minutes. Then again, she hadn’t planned on wandering around, speaking to nothing. Her nose was running from the tears, but instead of reaching into her pocket and pulling out the Kleenex she had brought, she wiped it on the shoulder of her sleeve. Screw personal hygiene.\\r\\nIt was hot and humid out, not the keenest day to be outdoors. The smart, would be inside their air-conditioned houses sipping lemonade, watching comedy Wednesdays on TV. Instead, Lanie searched.\\r\\n“It has to be here. It has to.” She whispered, exhausted. “It just has to be.” She checked the next headstone. ‘DORNBUSH’ it read. She was beginning to think the person she was looking for didn’t exist. She had to exist. She’d visited this place enough times to know where it was. They don’t just unbury bodies and replant them elsewhere! A new set of tears brimmed her eyelids, and another choking cry escaped. She didn’t care who was watching, it was a graveyard, for cripes sake. Crying was okay, it was practically mandatory.\\r\\nShe was lost. She’d covered the same length of distance at least three times, and still nothing. “This is where it was, this is the area you always were. I remember. I remember seeing you. Why can’t this just be easy.” Something in her life had to be right, had to be easy. Everything she seemed to do of late was horrible, or disapproving. Lanie needed to find her. She was the one person in this world who couldn’t judge her, or yell at her, or tell her she was a screw up. All things Lanie already knew. She just needed silence. Lanie figured in a graveyard, she could easily achieve that. But not any gravestone would do, she couldn’t just hunker down beside the Greenes, or the Temelltons, it needed to be her. It needed to be.\\r\\n“I didn’t come here to search for you! I came here to be with you!” She sniffled. “Just send me a sign! Show me where I’m supposed to go!” She collapsed herself against a tree and shrivelled down to sitting position. Drawing her knees to her chest, she wrapped her arms around, tucking them beneath her chin. She looked around, helpless. She didn’t come here to feel helpless. She felt this already, this emptiness. Nothing went as planned. She came here to relax, to let go, to cry. Not the tears of being lost, but tears to release all this anger she’d bottled inside her.\\r\\nSafety. That’s what Lanie came here for. She wanted to feel safe, for once. She needed to feel the burdens she carried, be lifted, if only for a few moments. It was so much more, she came for so much more. She needed a place, where she could be herself. A place where she could unwind, after a stressful day, and just be the person she was trying so desperately to become. Whoever that was.\\r\\nFinding herself was something Lanie needed to do, and with all these people breathing down her neck, she found it nearly impossible to do so. She was falling apart, piece by piece, she could feel it. They were telling her she was wrong, she was immature, easily pressured, incompetent, untrusting. She was tired of it. Tired of being judged, and constantly watched. She had to cover her tracks, be careful, and watch herself. It became more and more like a fulltime job and she had grown emotionally haggard.\\r\\nShe pulled her music player out, and plugged it into her ears to drown out the silence that had suddenly started to scream at her. She closed her eyes and leaned her head back to rest on the tree trunk. She inhaled deeply, and released a shaky breath.\\r\\nMusic was supposed to sooth her, it was supposed to heal her. She could feel her throat close up, and the welling of tears began. Fighting them back, she swallowed them down. She would not cry anymore, she could not.\\r\\nShe pulled the ear buds forcefully from her ears. The silence had turned deafening, and music could not protect her. Thoughts of her family gushed into her mind. She had let them down, again. She had let her friends down; she probably had even let herself down. Living up to people’s standards was exhausting, and time consuming.\\r\\nLanie pushed herself up from the ground and resumed talking to herself and the silence she needed to escape\\r\\n“I didn’t know you. I never even met you. They tell me I met you, and I was happy with you. But I was a baby, and I don’t remember. You were there for everyone else before me, why couldn’t you be there for me?” Tears rolled down her cheeks in an unsynchronized rhythm. “I need you now, and you’re not here. You’re supposed to be here, right here, I remember. I’ve visited you. Why aren’t you where I remember! You can be here for me, I need you to be here for me now.” She wiped at her nose with the backside of her hand. “Please,” she barely whispered. “Please be here. Let me find you.”\\r\\nIn the midst of her outburst, Lanie had ambled over the gravel path to another patch of headstones. She stopped, looking about her, she sighed. Looking down, she saw it. The name, carved perfectly in the sunken headstone. She fell on all fours and pressed her hand to the name. “Thank you.” She sobbed. “Thank you so much.”\\r\\nHer tears were no longer of anger, and abandonment, but of happiness, and a sense of accomplishment. She had scoured this place, for something that wasn’t where she had thought it was. She had felt as lost here, as she did in her own life. She’d felt helpless, in a place where all she wanted to feel was hope, and a sense of security.\\r\\nMaybe the search for the headstone was what Lanie needed. She needed to look where she shouldn’t, in order to open her eyes. To see something about her life that she hadn’t been able to see till now. She was looking for happiness, and solitude in her life in all the wrong places. She needed to look elsewhere, to family, to friends, to the people she knew were doing everything she despised, just to help her. The lady beneath the headstone had helped her in her path to self-discovery before Lanie had even found her.\\r\\n“I found you,” Lanie breathed. Perhaps in addition to, she’d just found a ray of hope for herself.\\r\\nRolling over to fall on her back, Lanie smiled. For the first time that evening, she smiled.

I got Spiderman in a Happy Meal that Dad bought me once. His arms and legs move, but he doesn’t have a web.\\r\\nMr. Gregory is my first grade teacher. I was supposed to be in Mrs. Anderson’s class this year, but the school put me in Mr. Gregory’s class by myself when I stopped using my voice. I like Mr. Gregory. He lets me read big kid books in class and he doesn’t yell. But sometimes his face gets really red and he stares at his hands for a long time, eyes closed. It’s how Dad looked when Mom got sick. I always thought Dad was angry, but really he was scared.\\r\\nMr. Gregory asks me questions while he drives.\\r\\n“Why did you miss your bus, Julian?” It’s snowing, the flakes zooming straight at us.  Mr. Gregory looked up my address in the school directory because Mom didn’t answer the phone. Mom sleeps in the afternoons. Spiderman is safe in my pocket because I’m not supposed to have him at school.\\r\\nMr. Gregory’s car smells like Red Hots candy. Mom used to buy Red Hots for Dad and he always shared them with me like a secret. I like them even though they make my throat burn.  When I breathe in through my nose I can taste cinnamon.\\r\\n“Is your Mom okay?” Mr. Gregory asks. I nod, but I’m lying.\\r\\n“Do you see your Dad sometimes?” I lie again.\\r\\n“How’s Megan?” Megan always goes to her boyfriend’s house after school. I don’t really mind. It used to make me very upset, but now I like it better than when Megan’s boyfriend comes to our house.\r\n \r\nMr. Gregory turns the car off in front of my house.\\r\\n“Julian, I know you’re tired of hearing this, but you have to talk eventually. We all know that you have a lot to say.” I’m not really listening because I’m staring at my house wishing that Megan would come home and Mom would wake up.\r\n \r\nThen Mr. Gregory grabs my leg hard. Moves his hand up towards my pocket. Towards Spiderman.  I feel that familiar pain in my stomach. The pain that keeps my voice locked up.  The pain of things being taken away. His hand hurts. I feel words kicking their way up my throat. Mr. Gregory’s hand moves to my pocket, pressing down hard. Spiderman’s cold arm digs into my hip.\r\nMy mouth is burning, and then—\\r\\n“No!” I say, my voice coming out like dragon breath, the words crackling. “Please don’t take Spiderman!” The words spill out too fast, like they had grown tired of waiting inside of me. “Please.” I take a breath because my voice is making my whole body shake.\\r\\nMr. Gregory’s hand jumps back, his eyes big and dark.\\r\\n“Spiderman?” His hand hangs in the air like the metal grabber in a claw machine. “Who is Spiderman?” His face is red and scared.\\r\\nAs I walk up the driveway, I feel very warm and very cold all at once. My voice made my heart beat too fast. I can see my breath in the air and I wonder if that’s what my voice looks like. I take Spiderman out of my pocket and grip him tight because I know he won’t get hurt. The air smells like ice but my throat is still burning. Mr. Gregory’s wheels crunch the gravel as he drives away.\\r\\nI lock my voice up inside of me again.\r\n \r\nWhen I found Spiderman on the playground one of his hands was sticking out the snow, a tiny red flag waving to me.

I got Spiderman in a Happy Meal that Dad bought me once. His arms and legs move, but he doesn’t have a web.\\r\\nMr. Gregory is my first grade teacher. I was supposed to be in Mrs. Anderson’s class this year, but the school put me in Mr. Gregory’s class by myself when I stopped using my voice. I like Mr. Gregory. He lets me read big kid books in class and he doesn’t yell. But sometimes his gets really red and he stares at his hands for a long time, eyes closed. It’s how Dad looked when Mom got sick. I always thought Dad was angry, but really he was scared.\\r\\nMr. Gregory asks me questions while he drives.\\r\\n“Why did you miss your bus, Julian?” It’s snowing, the flakes zooming straight at us.  Mr. Gregory looked up my address in the school directory because Mom didn’t answer the phone. Mom sleeps in the afternoons. Spiderman is safe in my pocket because I’m not supposed to have him at school.\\r\\nMr. Gregory’s car smells like Red Hots candy. Mom used to buy Red Hots for Dad and he always shared them with me like a secret. I like them even though they make my throat burn.  When I breathe in through my nose I can taste cinnamon.\\r\\n“Is your Mom okay?” Mr. Gregory asks. I nod, but I’m lying.\\r\\n“Do you see your Dad sometimes?” I lie again.\\r\\n“How’s Megan?” Megan always goes to her boyfriend’s house after school. I don’t really mind. It used to make me very upset, but now I like it better than when Megan’s boyfriend comes to our house.\r\n \r\nMr. Gregory turns the car off in front of my house.\\r\\n“Julian, I know you’re tired of hearing this, but you have to talk eventually. We all know that you have a lot to say.” I’m not really listening because I’m staring at my house wishing that Megan would come home and Mom would wake up.\r\n \r\nThen Mr. Gregory grabs my leg hard. Moves his hand up towards my pocket. Towards Spiderman.  I feel that familiar pain in my stomach. The pain that keeps my voice locked up.  The pain of things being taken away. His hand hurts. I feel words kicking their way up my throat. Mr. Gregory’s hand moves to my pocket, pressing down hard. Spiderman’s cold arm digs into my hip.\r\nMy mouth is burning, and then—\\r\\n“No!” I say, my voice coming out like dragon breath, the words crackling. “Please don’t take Spiderman!” The words spill out too fast, like they had grown tired of waiting inside of me. “Please.” I take a breath because my voice is making my whole body shake.\\r\\nMr. Gregory’s hand jumps back, his eyes big and dark.\\r\\n“Spiderman?” His hand hangs in the air like the metal grabber in a claw machine. “Who is Spiderman?” His face is red and scared.\\r\\nAs I walk up the driveway, I feel very warm and very cold all at once. My voice made my heart beat too fast. I can see my breath in the air and I wonder if that’s what my voice looks like. I take Spiderman out of my pocket and grip him tight because I know he won’t get hurt. The air smells like ice but my throat is still burning.

The man with the dirty shirt grinned, shrugged, then followed the girl inside.\\r\\n      “I can’t believe this is happening,” said Lee once the couple was gone. She opened the car door and sat down in the seat.

She could see the police moving around in her mother’s apartment through the window, dark silhouettes behind the fraying lace curtains. “Don’t talk about dead people that way,” she amended.\\r\\n      “Well, just think,” continued Jeff, quickly moving the rearview mirror so he couldn’t see the apartment building.  “If we lived in other countries, far, far away, they would have had to call someone else to tell them she was dead, to come and pick up her things. If I lived in Spain, I wouldn’t have to even come to the funeral.”\\r\\n      Lee snorted. “If you lived in Spain, you’d still come to the funeral. If you lived on Mars, you’d come to Mom’s funeral.”\\r\\n      “Maybe,” said Jeff. “Maybe, if only to make sure she was really dead.”\r\n<!--more-->\r\n      It wasn’t so much a funeral as dropping by the funeral home to pick up Loretta’s ashes. Lee felt more like she was going to the dry cleaner to claim a suit than to collect the final remains of her mother. Originally, she had proposed that the ashes be divided up into two small brass canisters, so that she and her brother could split their mother’s remains up equally, but Jeff hated the idea.\\r\\n      “Knowing you, you’ll give me the box with her ass in it,” he said, half-joking. “Ass and stinky old lady feet. Ass and stinky old lady feet and maybe a little hairy ex-hippie armpit.”\\r\\n      “God, that’s gross,” shuddered Lee. “And totally ridiculous.”\\r\\n      “Really, Lee, I don’t want any part of this.” He was adamant on this point. “I don’t want any part of Mom in my house. I don’t want to talk about Mom to my kids or my wife. I’m coming to Mom’s funeral for you, and no one else.”\\r\\n      So the ashes were not divided in separate mini-urns, even-steven, but dumped into one medium-sized, classy-looking bronze urn, the opening sealed with clear wax and Loretta’s name, date-of-birth and date-of-passing etched in calligraphic letters around the bottom.\\r\\n      “It’s pretty,” said Lee when the funeral director handed it to her.\\r\\n      “Very nice,” agreed Jeff, standing just behind her, his hands jammed in his pockets.\\r\\n        “It was our pleasure,” said the funeral director, bowing slightly. “If there’s anything else we can do for you, please let us know.”\\r\\n      “This is really weird,” Lee whisered as soon as the funeral director was gone. “Mom’s in here. Mom’s in this jar.”\\r\\n      “Yep,” said Jeff.\\r\\n      “I mean, she’s in here.” She held the urn out to Jeff. “She doesn’t weigh hardly anything now.”\\r\\n      “I’ll take your word for it,” said Jeff, backing up a step and putting his hands behind his back. “I’m not touching that thing.”\\r\\n      Lee sighed. “You’re going to have to let this shit go some time,” she said. “Whether you like it or not, she was your mother, and you can’t get away from that. She’s a part of you.”\\r\\n      “How ‘bout I just hang out with Dad, and pretend he was a single parent my whole life?” snapped Jeff. “Dad’s a drunk, but at least he never tried to kill me. Or you,” he added.\\r\\n      “She’s just ashes now,” said Lee, quietly. “Ashes and biology and whatever memories we want to keep.”\\r\\n      “You can’t just pick and choose which memories you want to have,” muttered Jeff. “You can’t just pick and choose.”\\r\\n      Their mother’s personal belongings ended up equaling almost exactly one car load. The apartment manager, who was now wearing a clean shirt, and his girlfriend stood in the hallway and watched as Lee and Jeff filled boxes with photographs of strangers in dollar-store frames, assorted non-prescription reading glasses,sheets of looseleaf paper covered in illegible scribbles, two or three black floppy discs for a computer that no longer existed, a closet full of clothes and shoes with matching purses. “I thought there’d be more,” said Lee when they were finished.\\r\\n      “I know,” agreed Jeff. “You’d think she’d have at least one picture of us somewhere in here, wouldn’t you?”\\r\\n      “That’s not what I meant,” protested  Lee, but Jeff cut her off.\\r\\n      “Okay, then, let’s say that I’m surprised there aren’t any pictures of her children in here.” He sighed. “I guess I meant about as much to her as she meant to me, eh?”\\r\\n      “The police hauled some stuff away as evidence, too,” called the manager’s girlfriend from the hallway. She stuck her head in the door and waved, as though asking for permission to speak. “You know, because of the way the bodies were found. They had a real hard time figuring out where one body ended and the other one began.”\\r\\n      “Shut up, Charlotte,” said her boyfriend. “They don’t want to hear about it.”\\r\\n      “What do you mean?” asked Lee. She got up from the floor and went to stand in the doorway. Jeff coughed nervously and followed her.\\r\\n      “Like we told your brother, the heat made the bodies sort of stick together,” continued the girlfriend quickly. “That’s what the police said it was. They said the other lady must’ve died of an overdose, and then your mother must’ve gotten in bed with her and shot herself. They were real close, you know,” she finished, putting her hand on Lee’s arm. “They were a sweet couple.”\\r\\n        Lee pulled away from the woman and shuddered. “You knew about this?” she asked Jeff. “Exactly how stuck together were they?”\\r\\n      “I didn’t ask for details,” answered Jeff.  “I tried not to hear as much as I did, to be honest. The guy I talked to on the phone was a fucking ghoul,” he added. “I wish you’d been the one to get the call. I really do. Since you actually give a shit about all of this.” He pushed past Lee and the couple in the hallway and stormed outside.\\r\\n      “So whose ashes do I have?” Lee shouted after him. “Is that why you didn’t want any of the ashes, because they’re not all Mom’s? Because they belong to some fucking junkie she shacked up with for less than a year?”\\r\\n      “They were both really nice ladies,” protested the manager’s girlfriend. She looked like she was about to cry. “I didn’t know there were drugs in here at all. I never would have guessed.”\\r\\n      “I didn’t think it was any of my business,” began the manager, then stopped. “I didn’t know either,” he amended quietly.\\r\\n      Lee shot him her most awful look and grabbed one of the boxes and stumbled out to the car. Jeff was standing by the car, looking down at the street. The urn was in his hands, the seal broken, the lid on the ground by his feet.\\r\\n      “Now you don’t have to wonder who’s in here,” he said when he saw Lee. He shook the last of the ashes out into the street, where a thin stream of muddy runoff quickly carried the gray soot into the waiting cistern. “You don’t have to wonder, because there’s nothing in here. There’s nobody here.” He handed the empty urn to Lee, a weird, strangely triumphant look on his face.  “Now you can keep flowers in it,” he added. It would look really nice with fresh flowers in it.”\\r\\n      Lee held the empty urn, reading her mother’s name, date-of-birth, date-of-passing, and the name again, over and over. Finally, she reached down and grabbed the lid, replacing it with a firm twist so it wouldn’t fall off on it’s own.\\r\\n      “Wouldn’t it be ironic if I used it as a cookie jar instead?” she asked Jeff, smiling wryly.\\r\\n      “Oh, since we never had cookies at home ourselves?” He laughed, and it was such a free, genuinely happy sound that Lee almost hugged him right then and there. “That would be hilarious. Christ, now I wish I had asked for my own urn.”\\r\\n      “We could go back to the funeral home and see if they’d make us another.”\\r\\n      “Nah,” said Jeff, throwing his arm around his sister and running one finger over the inscription on the urn. “You can have it. I’ll bring the kids over next weekend, and we’ll all eat cookies out of it. In honor of Mom,” he added, nodding. “Have to believe that she’d like that.”\\r\\n<em>Holly Day is a housewife and mother of two living in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

They were real close, you know,” she finished, putting her hand on Lee’s arm. “They were a sweet couple.”\n\n        Lee pulled away from the woman and shuddered. “You knew about this?” she asked Jeff. “Exactly how stuck together were they?”\n\n      “I didn’t ask for details,” answered Jeff.  “I tried not to hear as much as I did, to be honest. The guy I talked to on the phone was a fucking ghoul,” he added. “I wish you’d been the one to get the call. I really do. Since you actually give a shit about all of this.” He pushed past Lee and the couple in the hallway and stormed outside.\n\n      “So whose ashes do I have?” Lee shouted after him. “Is that why you didn’t want any of the ashes, because they’re not all Mom’s? Because they belong to some fucking junkie she shacked up with for less than a year?”\n\n      “They were both really nice ladies,” protested the manager’s girlfriend. She looked like she was about to cry. “I didn’t know there were drugs in here at all. I never would have guessed.”\n\n      “I didn’t think it was any of my business,” began the manager, then stopped. “I didn’t know either,” he amended quietly.\n\n      Lee shot him her most awful look and grabbed one of the boxes and stumbled out to the car. Jeff was standing by the car, looking down at the street. The urn was in his hands, the seal broken, the lid on the ground by his feet.\n\n      “Now you don’t have to wonder who’s in here,” he said when he saw Lee. He shook the last of the ashes out into the street, where a thin stream of muddy runoff quickly carried the gray soot into the waiting cistern. “You don’t have to wonder, because there’s nothing in here. There’s nobody here.” He handed the empty urn to Lee, a weird, strangely triumphant look on his face.  “Now you can keep flowers in it,” he added. It would look really nice with fresh flowers in it.”\n\n      Lee held the empty urn, reading her mother’s name, date-of-birth, date-of-passing, and the name again, over and over. Finally, she reached down and grabbed the lid, replacing it with a firm twist so it wouldn’t fall off on it’s own.\n\n      “Wouldn’t it be ironic if I used it as a cookie jar instead?” she asked Jeff, smiling wryly.\n\n      “Oh, since we never had cookies at home ourselves?” He laughed, and it was such a free, genuinely happy sound that Lee almost hugged him right then and there. “That would be hilarious. Christ, now I wish I had asked for my own urn.”\n\n      “We could go back to the funeral home and see if they’d make us another.”\n\n      “Nah,” said Jeff, throwing his arm around his sister and running one finger over the inscription on the urn. “You can have it. I’ll bring the kids over next weekend, and we’ll all eat cookies out of it. In honor of Mom,” he added, nodding. “Have to believe that she’d like that.”\n\n<em>Holly Day is a housewife and mother of two living in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

She did not want the couple to keep talking. Every word that came out of their mouths seemed destined to lay the entire physical tableau of her mother’s suicide out for her. She did not want to know any more than she did.\\r\\n      “After the police are done here, maybe you could come by and get her things?” said the girlfriend. “I asked them to open a window while they’re in there, so it should be pretty aired out.”\\r\\n      “Oh, yeah,” agreed the man with the dirty shirt. “I’ve had this happen lots of times in my buildings, and a day or so after the police have cleared the body out, you wouldn’t even know…well, you know.”\\r\\n      “We’ll be by,” said Jeff, grabbing Lee’s arm and pulling her towards the car. “Give us a call, and we’ll be by to clear out the apartment.”\\r\\n      “Thanks! You guys have a great day!” said the girlfriend, then blushed and ran into the apartment building. The man with the dirty shirt grinned, shrugged, then followed the girl inside.\\r\\n      “I can’t believe this is happening,” said Lee once the couple was gone. She opened the car door and sat down in the seat. Her bare skin stuck to the hot vinyl and burned.\\r\\n      “I can’t believe we only live fifteen minutes away from Mom,” said Jeff. “I can’t believe we still live in the same state as that psycho-bitch.” \\r\\n\"Don’t talk about Mom that way,” said Lee. She could see the police moving around in her mother’s apartment through the window, dark silhouettes behind the fraying lace curtains. “Don’t talk about dead people that way,” she amended.\\r\\n      “Well, just think,” continued Jeff, quickly moving the rearview mirror so he couldn’t see the apartment building.  “If we lived in other countries, far, far away, they would have had to call someone else to tell them she was dead, to come and pick up her things. If I lived in Spain, I wouldn’t have to even come to the funeral.”\\r\\n      Lee snorted. “If you lived in Spain, you’d still come to the funeral. If you lived on Mars, you’d come to Mom’s funeral.”\\r\\n      “Maybe,” said Jeff. “Maybe, if only to make sure she was really dead.”\r\n<!--more-->\r\n      It wasn’t so much a funeral as dropping by the funeral home to pick up Loretta’s ashes. Lee felt more like she was going to the dry cleaner to claim a suit than to collect the final remains of her mother. Originally, she had proposed that the ashes be divided up into two small brass canisters, so that she and her brother could split their mother’s remains up equally, but Jeff hated the idea.\\r\\n      “Knowing you, you’ll give me the box with her ass in it,” he said, half-joking. “Ass and stinky old lady feet. Ass and stinky old lady feet and maybe a little hairy ex-hippie armpit.”\\r\\n      “God, that’s gross,” shuddered Lee. “And totally ridiculous.”\\r\\n      “Really, Lee, I don’t want any part of this.” He was adamant on this point. “I don’t want any part of Mom in my house. I don’t want to talk about Mom to my kids or my wife. I’m coming to Mom’s funeral for you, and no one else.”\\r\\n      So the ashes were not divided in separate mini-urns, even-steven, but dumped into one medium-sized, classy-looking bronze urn, the opening sealed with clear wax and Loretta’s name, date-of-birth and date-of-passing etched in calligraphic letters around the bottom.\\r\\n      “It’s pretty,” said Lee when the funeral director handed it to her.\\r\\n      “Very nice,” agreed Jeff, standing just behind her, his hands jammed in his pockets.\\r\\n        “It was our pleasure,” said the funeral director, bowing slightly. “If there’s anything else we can do for you, please let us know.”\\r\\n      “This is really weird,” Lee whisered as soon as the funeral director was gone. “Mom’s in here. Mom’s in this jar.”\\r\\n      “Yep,” said Jeff.\\r\\n      “I mean, she’s in here.” She held the urn out to Jeff. “She doesn’t weigh hardly anything now.”\\r\\n      “I’ll take your word for it,” said Jeff, backing up a step and putting his hands behind his back. “I’m not touching that thing.”\\r\\n      Lee sighed. “You’re going to have to let this shit go some time,” she said. “Whether you like it or not, she was your mother, and you can’t get away from that. She’s a part of you.”\\r\\n      “How ‘bout I just hang out with Dad, and pretend he was a single parent my whole life?” snapped Jeff. “Dad’s a drunk, but at least he never tried to kill me. Or you,” he added.\\r\\n      “She’s just ashes now,” said Lee, quietly. “Ashes and biology and whatever memories we want to keep.”\\r\\n      “You can’t just pick and choose which memories you want to have,” muttered Jeff. “You can’t just pick and choose.”\\r\\n      Their mother’s personal belongings ended up equaling almost exactly one car load. The apartment manager, who was now wearing a clean shirt, and his girlfriend stood in the hallway and watched as Lee and Jeff filled boxes with photographs of strangers in dollar-store frames, assorted non-prescription reading glasses,sheets of looseleaf paper covered in illegible scribbles, two or three black floppy discs for a computer that no longer existed, a closet full of clothes and shoes with matching purses. “I thought there’d be more,” said Lee when they were finished.\\r\\n      “I know,” agreed Jeff. “You’d think she’d have at least one picture of us somewhere in here, wouldn’t you?”\\r\\n      “That’s not what I meant,” protested  Lee, but Jeff cut her off.\\r\\n      “Okay, then, let’s say that I’m surprised there aren’t any pictures of her children in here.” He sighed. “I guess I meant about as much to her as she meant to me, eh?”\\r\\n      “The police hauled some stuff away as evidence, too,” called the manager’s girlfriend from the hallway. She stuck her head in the door and waved, as though asking for permission to speak. “You know, because of the way the bodies were found. They had a real hard time figuring out where one body ended and the other one began.”\\r\\n      “Shut up, Charlotte,” said her boyfriend. “They don’t want to hear about it.”\\r\\n      “What do you mean?” asked Lee. She got up from the floor and went to stand in the doorway. Jeff coughed nervously and followed her.\\r\\n      “Like we told your brother, the heat made the bodies sort of stick together,” continued the girlfriend quickly. “That’s what the police said it was. They said the other lady must’ve died of an overdose, and then your mother must’ve gotten in bed with her and shot herself.

Later, she left for the city, her blonde hair swept into a forceful chignon and her heels high, but not vertiginous.\\r\\nAt the office Laurie spoke to the exact number of people necessary to fulfil her position''s requirements. This was less than two on any given day. As a book editor, her head was buried in manuscripts most of the time.

Nonetheless, she drove that body of hers on every day, because her parents were alive and his parents were alive, and everyone expected it of her.

He exhaled, thinking about what he had just heard, what she had just told him, breathing out in time with his thoughts.  The smoke floated up towards the dim porch light.\\r\\n“So you’re not coming back.”  Flat voice.\\r\\nThe woman shook her head.  He glanced down at the floor and rubbed the back of his head with a calloused hand.  The small glass table was the only witness to their conversation, the deck devoid of other furniture.\\r\\nHe grunted softly and continued. “Well, okay.”\r\n  \r\n“Okay?”  She shifted her weight from one leg to the other.  \\r\\n“Yes, okay.”\\r\\nShe turned to leave, aged boards creaking beneath her slight frame.  Just outside the threshold of the room she hesitated, pale fingers caressing the doorframe.  \\r\\n“I can’t, I just can’t.”  His gaze rose to the back of her head.  She turned, still holding the frame, but couldn’t look at him.  “I...” She stopped.  “You understand.”\\r\\nHe said nothing.  Her eyes flitted towards his but fell short of a reunion.  She exited the porch, skirt hurrying after her, and the man turned to face the shore.  He rested his elbows on the weathered wooden railing and stared.  Blank eyes took in nothing. \\r\\nA sudden splash in the water demanded his recognition.  A sea otter, shell on its belly, rock in its hands, preparing supper.  He watched the diligent animal fix itself a meal.  Who would crack his oysters now?\\r\\nHe finished his cigarette, flicked it over the rail.  The butt glowed warm on the sand and he studied at it as he drew another from his breast pocket.  He realized that he needed to pee, but instead closed his eyes.  He visualized the house, his house, walked through every room noting every detail and committing it to memory.  He opened his eyes and sighed.  Sticking the cigarette between his lips and pausing briefly to light, he then hopped over the rail onto the sand.  His left foot landed on the first smoldering butt and he picked it up in surprise.  It burned him a little as he held it on his hand.  Discarding the useless filter, he kicked sand over it and began to walk to the water while unbuttoning his shirt.  He removed his blue jeans and underwear and piled them with his shirt about ten feet from the water’s edge.  His second cigarette dropped to the sand.

The N333 is sat in the bay as he approaches, indicators flashing and doors closing as it goes to pull away. Rory hammers with the side of his fist on the damp red flank of the bus and, luckily, the driver pauses to let him on.\n\nIt is the older style of bus; the fabric on the seats is orange, shot through with geometrical shapes in a mustard yellow. The paint on the hold bar flecks off in his palm as he grabs the pole to steady himself as the bus jerks into the stream of traffic.  They always bring out the old fleet of buses for this nothing period of the night, where the only people likely to be traveling are too drunk or too tired to care about the damp smell and abrasive seating.\n\nRory swings off the hold bar into a seat towards the back, where he can feel the rumbling of the left rear wheel under his feet. He is just settling himself, wedging his knees against the seat in front, when the bus eases into its next stop and a girl gets on.\n\nShe presses her Oystercard holder to the reader and then twists to slip it into her handbag as she moves down the aisle of the bus. He cannot see her face, but her hair is straight and blonde, her figure trim in a short black jacket and jeans. Her fingers are long and thin, pianist fingers, with chipped pale pink nail varnish. She tosses her damp hair over her shoulder as she swings her bag into a seat, and slides in after it.\n\nThree rows ahead of him, she is hyper-real, each strand of hair haloed as the fluorescent tube bulb overhead picks up the droplets of rain clinging there. She fidgets - can she sense his eyes upon her? – and pulls her phone from her bag. The screen lights up as she flips the phone open and closed. No messages. She tosses her phone back into her bag and turns to face the window.\n\nHer face thrown back by the dark window is what Rory expected; she is pale and strong featured. The rain on the outside of the glass gouges across the reflection of her face in streaks as the bus hits a straight road and moves up a gear. The two sit in silence as the bus trundles on through sleeping London. If she does sense his attention, she makes no sign of it.\n\nThe bus slows once more, but passes the next stop without pausing when the driver sees no passengers waiting there. The blonde girl pulls her phone from her bag again, distractedly. No messages. Who was she expecting a text from at this time of night, Rory wonders.\n\nAnother stop, this time to let off a passenger who had been sitting on the upstairs deck. The drunken woman lurches off into the night, and the driver hesitates at his wheel as he peers into the darkness after her, willing her home safely. The blonde girl shifts restlessly in her seat; she is eager to get home herself and there are only a few stops left to travel.\n\nSlowly, slowly, the bus pulls away onto the road again. It is the darkest point of the night; moon and stars have set, but there is yet to be even the slightest chink of light in the eastern sky. The streetlights cast the world as orange and dull, reflecting hazily off of the wet humps of parked cars. The bus headlights shine straight, illuminating the rear of the night bus ahead.\n\nThe penultimate stop; the driver slows and carries on past when he sees that it too is empty. Rory knows that time is short now, minutes only. But he does nothing but watch the blonde girl as she checks her phone for a third time, and, once again, is disappointed. She places it back into her bag and zips it up.\n\nPreparing for the short walk ahead of her, the girl pulls her hair back and rotates her shoulders as she inches towards the edge of her seat. A quick dash through the rain and she would be home; it had been a long day. Rory too, is preparing himself for leaving the close shelter of the bus, for braving the dark and the rain awaiting outside.\n\nThis bus terminates here. The blonde girl stands before the bus comes to a stop, clutching the pole by the exit doors as she adjusts the weight of her handbag on her shoulder. The doors slide open with a hiss and the blonde girl hops down. He hears the loose tarmac of the bus bay crunch under her feet as she lands somewhere in the darkness beyond the doors.\n\nHe is mere seconds behind her, but he knows now that however quickly he follows her, she is always gone by the time he reaches the doors. He is left with nothing but the shadows in the bus station. Behind him the bus gives a shudder and the lights die. The driver, shift half over, hops down from the front entrance. Giving Rory a perfunctory nod, collar up against the rain, he stalks off in search of a warm drink in a polystyrene cup to see him through till dawn.\n\nRory’s feet are aching again. He turns down a cobbled mews road, the shortcut home, out of habit more than anything. It only saves about three minutes. He stops suddenly; the streetlights refracting over the tops of the buildings are playing tricks on him, conjuring up the light of a pale face, of blonde hair tossed over a shoulder. She stalks ahead of him, leading the way home; surely it is just the pattering of the rain that is drowning out her heels clicking against the cobbles?\n\nFor the sake of three minutes; for the sake of an empty purse – Emma never trusted herself with cash; for the sake of a few extra hours sleep on his part, she was left like a rag doll there in these narrow mews, the blood soaked deep into the darkness of her jacket but oh so red against the paleness of her skin, of her hair, of the suede bag she clutched so fiercely to her chest, even in death.\n\nRory walks on, following the lights. He always picked her up from the bus station after she finished a night shift, but that night he had been irritable, tired. He’d needed the sleep. And so now, that sleep denies him is a justice that he welcomes. And so night after night he walks the rainy streets, following the sheen of her hair in the dark.\n\n<em>Erin''s work is collected in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ZCR0M8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B006ZCR0M8&linkCode=as2&tag=backhandstori-20\">\"The Last Train Home\", now available on Amazon.com</a></em>', 'The Night Bus by Erin Lawless', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '185-autosave-v1', '', '', '2012-09-10 13:02:09', '2012-09-10 21:02:09', '', 185, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/185-autosave/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

He’d said it so calmly it took me a moment to hear it. He’d saved a man’s life.\r\nWhat did this mean for me?\\r\\nSuddenly, my empty breakfast bowl became filled with wonder. The day unravelled before me like a sacred scroll. All who saw me would become blinded by my second-hand glory. I wondered if the lucky ones might even touch the hem of my hand-me-down garment and be healed…\\r\\nMy father had saved a man’s life.\\r\\nSunlight crowned his head with gold as Dad recounted the night’s events in measured tones: The man had been drinking. He had fallen asleep with a lit cigarette. He had kept trying to go back inside to find his dog… There must have been firetrucks. And ambulances. Sirens, probably. I couldn’t believe I slept through it all; couldn’t believe they let me sleep through it!\\r\\nI couldn’t believe my dad had done that. And he was still eating Weeties like he always did, just with shorter eyebrows.\\r\\nToday, on the way home from work, unit number 31 was on fire. There was nobody inside, so I knocked on the door of the man at number 32. Sitting on the footpath as the firetrucks arrived, he told me he had been partway through The Lion King when I saved his life. I was pretty sure the setting sun was crowning my head with gold, but I don’t think he noticed.\\r\\nIt was Jack’s family who lived in the rental across from the units. They’d had trouble from day one, both inside and outside the house. His stepdad threw Jack’s mum around a lot and kept her on the usual leash. When Jack visited our house one Christmas afternoon, his head was bleeding from being thrown up against the aquarium by that man. His mother had gone without food to pay for presents. So we invited Jack to mow our lawns. I’d suggested ten dollars payment, but he’d shook his head. Too much. He insisted on being paid five dollars front and back, since he was convinced we needed the money. Ten years old, he used to ride past our house once a week to check if the lawns needed mowing. He was always happy to get the mower out of the shed, start it up himself and get into it…\\r\\nAt school, he would shout at teachers, and storm down the corridors with a furrowed brow. He used to punch and head-butt walls. And go for long, long walks, far from where his name was being muttered by the grown-ups in the staff room. At our house, he’d put the mower away, take his shoes off at the back door and come in for a cordial. Never asked for money, either. He’d just raise his eyebrows at me and smile.\\r\\nJack was guileless. Once, a friend and I took him and one of his friends out for a day trip. Two men and two young fellas in a car for a day – it was a riot. The boys reminded me of puppies, yapping and playing constantly until one would nip the other and then there would be a fight. A minute later, they would be playing again.\\r\\nWe’d been driving for half an hour when, out of the blue, Jack says “One time when I was praying I asked what I would do when I growed up and I heard singing.”\\r\\nIn the front seats, my friend and I looked at each other with wide, curious eyes.\\r\\nStraight away, Jack’s mate says “That would have been God and all of his little helpers.”\\r\\n“Mmm,” says Jack carelessly. “Let’s play Eye Spy.”\\r\\nJack said he spied something starting with R. It took us two country towns and a hell of a lot of highway to work out the worst speller in 4/5 Edwards was spying the windshield. We laughed all the way through Longford.\\r\\nSo, the reason my father’s eyebrows were singed way back then was because he had rescued a man from a burning building the night before. The reason my car stinks like smoke today is because I’d parked it in front of a fiery housing commission unit last Monday, only to be parked in by two firetrucks as the building’s black breath billowed for hours.\\r\\nI’m standing on the footpath, same spot I sat one week ago, right out front of where Jack used to live. The descendant of some troglodyte is directing the reins of a petrol-powered brachiosaurus, removing the last few gigantic charred timber ribs from the body of just another roasted leviathan. The job done, he switches the engine off and leans back into his seat. The beast clunks obediently into stillness, jaws tilted skyward.\\r\\nHe has seen me but does not acknowledge me. I don’t really want to talk anyway. I’m just looking at the black dirt square where someone’s home used to be. It seems so small…\\r\\n“Housing won’t rebuild it,” he shrugs, chin pointing at the empty space. “Not for another five years. Policy.”\\r\\nI say nothing, my eyes surveying the location where something became nothing.\\r\\n“It’s policy not to rebuild for five years,” he reiterates. “Otherwise they just burn ‘em all like dominoes.”\\r\\nI cross the road in silence, eyes fixed on the almost imperceptible pea-green specks throughout the sable earth. Just above my line of sight, he is clambering out of the machine.\\r\\n“Yeah, nah,” he continues, black boots thudding like Clydesdale hooves into the muck. “Won’t rebuild it.”\\r\\nWe are now standing a couple of meters apart, staring at that space where red bricks became blackened and then became someone’s first job on a Monday, at the chocolatey loam where a concrete slab used to be, and at the tiny emerald blades pushing peacefully towards the blue.\\r\\nThen I hear my voice.\\r\\n“I had no idea grass could grow so quickly.”', 'Like Fire On a House by Daniel Townsend', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', '409', '', '', '2020-07-22 18:41:40', '2020-07-23 02:41:40', '', 0, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/?p=409', 0, 'post', '', 19);

He’d said it so calmly it took me a moment to hear it. He’d saved a man’s life.\r\nWhat did this mean for me?\r\n<!--more-->\\r\\nSuddenly, my empty breakfast bowl became filled with wonder. The day unravelled before me like a sacred scroll. All who saw me would become blinded by my second-hand glory. I wondered if the lucky ones might even touch the hem of my hand-me-down garment and be healed…\\r\\nMy father had saved a man’s life.\\r\\nSunlight crowned his head with gold as Dad recounted the night’s events in measured tones: The man had been drinking. He had fallen asleep with a lit cigarette. He had kept trying to go back inside to find his dog… There must have been firetrucks. And ambulances. Sirens, probably. I couldn’t believe I slept through it all; couldn’t believe they let me sleep through it!\\r\\nI couldn’t believe my dad had done that. And he was still eating Weeties like he always did, just with shorter eyebrows.\\r\\nToday, on the way home from work, unit number 31 was on fire. There was nobody inside, so I knocked on the door of the man at number 32. Sitting on the footpath as the firetrucks arrived, he told me he had been partway through The Lion King when I saved his life. I was pretty sure the setting sun was crowning my head with gold, but I don’t think he noticed.\\r\\nIt was Jack’s family who lived in the rental across from the units. They’d had trouble from day one, both inside and outside the house. His stepdad threw Jack’s mum around a lot and kept her on the usual leash. When Jack visited our house one Christmas afternoon, his head was bleeding from being thrown up against the aquarium by that man. His mother had gone without food to pay for presents. So we invited Jack to mow our lawns. I’d suggested ten dollars payment, but he’d shook his head. Too much. He insisted on being paid five dollars front and back, since he was convinced we needed the money. Ten years old, he used to ride past our house once a week to check if the lawns needed mowing. He was always happy to get the mower out of the shed, start it up himself and get into it…\\r\\nAt school, he would shout at teachers, and storm down the corridors with a furrowed brow. He used to punch and head-butt walls. And go for long, long walks, far from where his name was being muttered by the grown-ups in the staff room. At our house, he’d put the mower away, take his shoes off at the back door and come in for a cordial. Never asked for money, either. He’d just raise his eyebrows at me and smile.\\r\\nJack was guileless. Once, a friend and I took him and one of his friends out for a day trip. Two men and two young fellas in a car for a day – it was a riot. The boys reminded me of puppies, yapping and playing constantly until one would nip the other and then there would be a fight.

Just outside the threshold of the room she hesitated, pale fingers caressing the doorframe.  \\r\\n“I can’t, I just can’t.”  His gaze rose to the back of her head.  She turned, still holding the frame, but couldn’t look at him.  “I...” She stopped.  “You understand.”\\r\\nHe said nothing.  Her eyes flitted towards his but fell short of a reunion.  She exited the porch, skirt hurrying after her, and the man turned to face the shore.  He rested his elbows on the weathered wooden railing and stared.  Blank eyes took in nothing. \\r\\nA sudden splash in the water demanded his recognition.  A sea otter, shell on its belly, rock in its hands, preparing supper.  He watched the diligent animal fix itself a meal.  Who would crack his oysters now?\\r\\nHe finished his cigarette, flicked it over the rail.  The butt glowed warm on the sand and he studied at it as he drew another from his breast pocket.  He realized that he needed to pee, but instead closed his eyes.  He visualized the house, his house, walked through every room noting every detail and committing it to memory.  He opened his eyes and sighed.  Sticking the cigarette between his lips and pausing briefly to light, he then hopped over the rail onto the sand.  His left foot landed on the first smoldering butt and he picked it up in surprise.  It burned him a little as he held it on his hand.  Discarding the useless filter, he kicked sand over it and began to walk to the water while unbuttoning his shirt.  He removed his blue jeans and underwear and piled them with his shirt about ten feet from the water’s edge.  His second cigarette dropped to the sand.  The man waded naked into the surf and let the water push him.  He felt one with the swelling and receding of the waves.  He looked around for the otter, but couldn’t find it.  \\r\\nDripping, carrying his clothes away from his body to keep them dry, he walked back up the beach to the house.  He placed his clothing over the railing and pulled himself over the rail in a surprisingly nimble fashion for a man with his frame.  He left his clothes on the porch and went into the house.  He spent the rest of his night destroying all of her things.', 'Cracked Shell by Sean Gallagher', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', '367-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-07-10 12:07:41', '2016-07-10 20:07:41', '', 367, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/367-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

There’s no cruising, there’s the void. There’s no laughter, there’s the empty chair. Judy’s dead. No one wants to dance anyway. Keys put in pockets, not out where you can see. And know. Judy’s dead.

From the car to the door to the car again, anything could happen. Limp wrists forgotten, beer cans and bottles heaved; rain of coins on the cops. From nowhere came an uprooted parking meter.

This downtown dive he’d never seen before. Allen, who was father of us all, stood in astonishment. A bold beginning. Allen, who held Whitman in his pocket, told the world to fuck off that night.

Love is marriage and happy-ever-after. So they tell me. But it didn’t happen that way. Love was a black-haired boy. Two condoms, one mint we shared with a kiss. The dog barking downstairs.

I take the train to work, look at my cubical wall and the photographs from the vacation I took last summer, or my feet in the orange tennis shoes I was wearing that day against the dirty pavement of Broadway and the filth and the flat black-holed, dilapidated, chewing gum stuck to the earth seems like the universe beneath my toes and I’m about to fall, a permanent feeling pinned to my cubical wall. \\r\\nThere is no work but the office is loud, I look around and see a coworker on a business call. Looking at his own photographs, pinned to his own cubical wall.\\r\\nI go to the street at the end of the day and everybody is standing around, blowing in the wind in the colors of the season. One female with long legs and a light blue sock-hat stands a few paces onto the road, waiting, looking around, although the light reads ''GO''. Our eyes meet as I tilt my head back to sip the coffee in my hand and I look at her from the corner of my eye as I walk by and she does so as well.\\r\\nAt the entrance to the underground I turn my head over my left shoulder to see her still standing as she was, with the cars passing in front of her face. I walk down the steps with my head still turned and between her thin legs, at intervals when the cars pass by, I see the sun setting on the horizon of 14th Street and the West Side Highway.\\r\\nI regret, but it’s too late, and I forget.\\r\\nI get on the train. I read. I walk home and wait; something will happen. I play a song on my guitar, Don’t Know Why, then The Birds and the Bees, and my cellphone disrupts the music of practice and progress. It’s a reply to a text I sent this morning, ‘I left at 11am’ she says. I ask if she has plans for the weekend. Still no response, I wait; something will happen.

I got Spiderman in a Happy Meal that Dad bought me once. His arms and legs move, but he doesn’t have a web.\\r\\nMr. Gregory is my first grade teacher. I was supposed to be in Mrs. Anderson’s class this year, but the school put me in Mr. Gregory’s class by myself when I stopped using my voice. I like Mr. Gregory. He lets me read big kid books in class and he doesn’t yell. But sometimes his face gets really red and he stares at his hands for a long time, eyes closed. It’s how Dad looked when Mom got sick. I always thought Dad was angry, but really he was scared.\\r\\nMr. Gregory asks me questions while he drives.\\r\\n“Why did you miss your bus, Julian?” It’s snowing, the flakes zooming straight at us.  Mr. Gregory looked up my address in the school directory because Mom didn’t answer the phone. Mom sleeps in the afternoons. Spiderman is safe in my pocket because I’m not supposed to have him at school.\\r\\nMr. Gregory’s car smells like Red Hots candy. Mom used to buy Red Hots for Dad and he always shared them with me like a secret. I like them even though they make my throat burn.  When I breathe in through my nose I can taste cinnamon.\\r\\n“Is your Mom okay?” Mr. Gregory asks. I nod, but I’m lying.\\r\\n“Do you see your Dad sometimes?” I lie again.\\r\\n“How’s Megan?” Megan always goes to her boyfriend’s house after school. I don’t really mind. It used to make me very upset, but now I like it better than when Megan’s boyfriend comes to our house.\r\n \r\nMr. Gregory turns the car off in front of my house.\\r\\n“Julian, I know you’re tired of hearing this, but you have to talk eventually. We all know that you have a lot to say.” I’m not really listening because I’m staring at my house wishing that Megan would come home and Mom would wake up.\r\n \r\nThen Mr. Gregory grabs my leg hard. Moves his hand up towards my pocket. Towards Spiderman.  I feel that familiar pain in my stomach. The pain that keeps my voice locked up.  The pain of things being taken away. His hand hurts. I feel words kicking their way up my throat. Mr. Gregory’s hand moves to my pocket, pressing down hard. Spiderman’s cold arm digs into my hip.\r\nMy mouth is burning, and then—\\r\\n“No!” I say, my voice coming out like dragon breath, the words crackling. “Please don’t take Spiderman!” The words spill out too fast, like they had grown tired of waiting inside of me. “Please.” I take a breath because my voice is making my whole body shake.\\r\\nMr. Gregory’s hand jumps back, his eyes big and dark.\\r\\n“Spiderman?” His hand hangs in the air like the metal grabber in a claw machine. “Who is Spiderman?” His face is red and scared.\\r\\nAs I walk up the driveway, I feel very warm and very cold all at once. My voice made my heart beat too fast. I can see my breath in the air and I wonder if that’s what my voice looks like. I take Spiderman out of my pocket and grip him tight because I know he won’t get hurt. The air smells like ice but my throat is still burning. Mr. Gregory’s wheels crunch the gravel as he drives away.\\r\\nI lock my voice up inside of me again.\r\n \r\nWhen I found Spiderman on the playground one of his hands was sticking out the snow, a tiny red flag waving to me.

I couldn''t help it; there was nothing in my short life that had prepared me to react to the situation at hand, nothing to compare to this, and I could think of nothing to say. We lay, watching the slow drift of carefree clouds across the pale blue sky, watching the partially clothed trees as they lazily shed another article of disguise. These were the days of ending, of fading and letting go; these were the days of release, and she was releasing everything into the air of our temporary refuge.\\r\\n\"It''s not fair,\" she said bluntly, the words stinging the air like the bitter breeze when it kicked up and whipped our faces. \"It''s not fair.\"\\r\\n\"I know,\" I whispered softly, unsure and at a loss as to what else to say. \"I know, and I''m sorry.\" I immediately felt stupid, selfish saying that, out of touch and ashamed, but I was helpless to the situation. I felt helpless and hopeless, cold inside in a way that had nothing to do with the encroaching end of the year.\\r\\n\"It''s like -\" she started, and trailed off. \"Like everything you ever wanted...\"\\r\\nWe slipped into an endless silence, and I knew she was crying. She was my best friend, had been my only best friend, had lived down the street and around the corner from me for as long as I could remember. We had wandered through the paths in our neighborhood, explored the massive woods nearby in comfortable silence, but this was by far the worst. Everything now felt hollow, empty. The days of running and laughing through the wide open fields, of sitting on swings and staring up at the stars, of getting muddy and hunting for frogs in Three-Mile Creek, they felt so far away from this decaying pile of plant matter that we had made our sanctuary.\\r\\nShe sniffed back a tear and I reached for her arm, the only warmth amongst the crackling red and orange and gold. \"I''m sorry,\" I whispered again. I wanted to fill the chill air with words and comfort and reassurance, anything, but nothing would come. My hand slid down her arm and came to rest in hers, and we lay there, soaking in the bony skeletons of the birch and oak that blotted the sky.\\r\\n\"It''s not real,\" she said - \"it can''t be real. It was never supposed to come to this.\" We laid there immersed in our silence, at a loss for words, for two hours as the sun sank low, vacillating back and forth between disbelief and silence. What it is and what could have been. Dry eyes and tears.\\r\\n\"Hey Meg!\" her father called eventually from the front porch. \"Why don''t you come on inside?\"\\r\\n\"Coming!\" she called, and turned to me. She looked me up and down, covered in leaves, and laughed. \"You look ridiculous!\" she said, burying me in the rest of the pile and rolling out into the grass. We stood up, brushing leaves from our clothes, and I offered a tentative smile. \"I''ll see ya tomorrow, Meg,\" I said uncertainly.\\r\\n\"She grabbed me and pulled me in close. \"Of course, Tommy,\" she said happily. \"See you tomorrow.\"\\r\\n-\\r\\nThe next day, she was gone. I came home from school and burst through our front door, calling \"Hey Mom!\" over my shoulder as I raced my younger brother to the top of the stairs. Skidding into my room to unpack my bag, the ringing of the phone reverberated throughout the house. Faintly, I heard my mother answer, and continued throwing my books onto my bed. I had just changed my shirt and was searching for where I flung my shoes when the knock came at my door.\\r\\n\"Tommy?\" she said, opening it slightly, and before she said anything else, I knew. A coldness swept through me as I jammed my foot into my shoe and pushed past my mother, ignoring her calls, and sprinted out the door. Hitting the cold asphalt of the road, I raced toward the corner with a growing, internal plea of \"no no no no no no no\" careening around my head, each word keeping pace with my steps. Reaching the corner I hurtled onto the next street, gaining steam and running flat out, disregarding the pain in my stomach and legs. I reached number 23 Hemlock Street in what must have been a record time and stopped in the driveway, catching my breath. The house sat empty, shorn of life, and I stared back at it, unbelieving. Everything dropped out of me and I nearly fell, staggering sideways into the yard.\\r\\nI was in a fog, my thoughts consumed by the faltering refrain in my head. It was with a jolt that I reached the pile of leaves, slightly disfigured by the Autumn wind, but with two distinct imprints marking their territory. Two distinct outlines the size of two idealistic kids. Two reserved spaces with only one body to fill them both.\\r\\nSlowly, I lowered myself into my perfectly molded, red, orange and gold chamber. There was no sun today as I looked up from our beautifully crafted safe haven, just grey skies and freezing temperatures. It was November 19th, the coldest day of the year so far, and the last leaves from the birch and oak above me were slowly, one by one, detaching themselves from the safety of their branches and letting go, twirling gently toward their final repose.\\r\\nThe days were fading, the year was ending, the trees were letting go and, lying right here, I thought, she had had her release. I hadn''t said a word of meaning, had laid right next to her and soaked it all in while we watched the sun sink and the trees give it all up, and she had, I hoped, had her release. We laid there in silence and soaked in the Autumn, soaking in the best friendship, soaking in the years and the memories and the conversations and then, before anyone could help it, she was gone.\\r\\nHot tears rolled down my face as I laid in our carefully plotted hideaway, destined to remain only half-full for as long as it lasted. The day, again, was ending and I laid, again, in a helpless silence. As I stared through the naked branches above, in our frozen, brittle fortress of leaves, it began, softly at first, then gaining steam, to snow.\\r\\nI sat up, watching the decaying red, the dying orange, the fading gold, turn gradually to white. Standing, I turned once more to number 23 Hemlock Street, glanced once more at the blank windows of the living room I knew so well, and surveyed for the last time the carefully raked pile of leaves, occupancy two, the biggest pile on the street, as the two noticeable indentations filled gradually with white. Gradually transformed to something new. Fading, but still a clear reminder.\\r\\nThe year was ending, but not everything was gone forever.\\r\\n<em>Dan Rys is a 22-year-old writer/journalist from Syracuse new York now living in Boston, MA.

We had known each other for eight years, since we first poked fun at each other on the playgrounds of first grade, and here she was, telling it like it is.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\"You could tear out all the hair on your head, rip all the freckles off your face and arms, and stomp on them until they''re a twisted, matted mess, and you couldn''t understand.\"\\r\\nI lay there with her, both of us entombed together in our momentary creation, and was all too aware of my silence. I couldn''t help it; there was nothing in my short life that had prepared me to react to the situation at hand, nothing to compare to this, and I could think of nothing to say. We lay, watching the slow drift of carefree clouds across the pale blue sky, watching the partially clothed trees as they lazily shed another article of disguise. These were the days of ending, of fading and letting go; these were the days of release, and she was releasing everything into the air of our temporary refuge.\\r\\n\"It''s not fair,\" she said bluntly, the words stinging the air like the bitter breeze when it kicked up and whipped our faces. \"It''s not fair.\"\\r\\n\"I know,\" I whispered softly, unsure and at a loss as to what else to say. \"I know, and I''m sorry.\" I immediately felt stupid, selfish saying that, out of touch and ashamed, but I was helpless to the situation. I felt helpless and hopeless, cold inside in a way that had nothing to do with the encroaching end of the year.\\r\\n\"It''s like -\" she started, and trailed off. \"Like everything you ever wanted...\"\\r\\nWe slipped into an endless silence, and I knew she was crying. She was my best friend, had been my only best friend, had lived down the street and around the corner from me for as long as I could remember. We had wandered through the paths in our neighborhood, explored the massive woods nearby in comfortable silence, but this was by far the worst. Everything now felt hollow, empty. The days of running and laughing through the wide open fields, of sitting on swings and staring up at the stars, of getting muddy and hunting for frogs in Three-Mile Creek, they felt so far away from this decaying pile of plant matter that we had made our sanctuary.\\r\\nShe sniffed back a tear and I reached for her arm, the only warmth amongst the crackling red and orange and gold. \"I''m sorry,\" I whispered again. I wanted to fill the chill air with words and comfort and reassurance, anything, but nothing would come. My hand slid down her arm and came to rest in hers, and we lay there, soaking in the bony skeletons of the birch and oak that blotted the sky.\\r\\n\"It''s not real,\" she said - \"it can''t be real. It was never supposed to come to this.\" We laid there immersed in our silence, at a loss for words, for two hours as the sun sank low, vacillating back and forth between disbelief and silence. What it is and what could have been. Dry eyes and tears.\\r\\n\"Hey Meg!\" her father called eventually from the front porch. \"Why don''t you come on inside?\"\\r\\n\"Coming!\" she called, and turned to me. She looked me up and down, covered in leaves, and laughed. \"You look ridiculous!\" she said, burying me in the rest of the pile and rolling out into the grass. We stood up, brushing leaves from our clothes, and I offered a tentative smile. \"I''ll see ya tomorrow, Meg,\" I said uncertainly.\\r\\n\"She grabbed me and pulled me in close. \"Of course, Tommy,\" she said happily. \"See you tomorrow.\"\\r\\n-\\r\\nThe next day, she was gone. I came home from school and burst through our front door, calling \"Hey Mom!\" over my shoulder as I raced my younger brother to the top of the stairs. Skidding into my room to unpack my bag, the ringing of the phone reverberated throughout the house. Faintly, I heard my mother answer, and continued throwing my books onto my bed. I had just changed my shirt and was searching for where I flung my shoes when the knock came at my door.\\r\\n\"Tommy?\" she said, opening it slightly, and before she said anything else, I knew. A coldness swept through me as I jammed my foot into my shoe and pushed past my mother, ignoring her calls, and sprinted out the door. Hitting the cold asphalt of the road, I raced toward the corner with a growing, internal plea of \"no no no no no no no\" careening around my head, each word keeping pace with my steps. Reaching the corner I hurtled onto the next street, gaining steam and running flat out, disregarding the pain in my stomach and legs. I reached number 23 Hemlock Street in what must have been a record time and stopped in the driveway, catching my breath. The house sat empty, shorn of life, and I stared back at it, unbelieving. Everything dropped out of me and I nearly fell, staggering sideways into the yard.\\r\\nI was in a fog, my thoughts consumed by the faltering refrain in my head. It was with a jolt that I reached the pile of leaves, slightly disfigured by the Autumn wind, but with two distinct imprints marking their territory. Two distinct outlines the size of two idealistic kids. Two reserved spaces with only one body to fill them both.\\r\\nSlowly, I lowered myself into my perfectly molded, red, orange and gold chamber. There was no sun today as I looked up from our beautifully crafted safe haven, just grey skies and freezing temperatures. It was November 19th, the coldest day of the year so far, and the last leaves from the birch and oak above me were slowly, one by one, detaching themselves from the safety of their branches and letting go, twirling gently toward their final repose.\\r\\nThe days were fading, the year was ending, the trees were letting go and, lying right here, I thought, she had had her release. I hadn''t said a word of meaning, had laid right next to her and soaked it all in while we watched the sun sink and the trees give it all up, and she had, I hoped, had her release. We laid there in silence and soaked in the Autumn, soaking in the best friendship, soaking in the years and the memories and the conversations and then, before anyone could help it, she was gone.\\r\\nHot tears rolled down my face as I laid in our carefully plotted hideaway, destined to remain only half-full for as long as it lasted. The day, again, was ending and I laid, again, in a helpless silence. As I stared through the naked branches above, in our frozen, brittle fortress of leaves, it began, softly at first, then gaining steam, to snow.\\r\\nI sat up, watching the decaying red, the dying orange, the fading gold, turn gradually to white. Standing, I turned once more to number 23 Hemlock Street, glanced once more at the blank windows of the living room I knew so well, and surveyed for the last time the carefully raked pile of leaves, occupancy two, the biggest pile on the street, as the two noticeable indentations filled gradually with white. Gradually transformed to something new. Fading, but still a clear reminder.\\r\\nThe year was ending, but not everything was gone forever.\\r\\n<em>Dan Rys is a 22-year-old writer/journalist from Syracuse new York now living in Boston, MA.

(459, 1, '2020-07-26 19:46:13', '2020-07-27 03:46:13', 'I must be fucking cursed. \\r\\nGod’s punishing me. He always has. That’s why things come so easy to everybody else and why I have to fight like hell to just hold on to the little I got.\\r\\n“You shouldn’t talk like that,” my mother says. She whispers it, like she’s afraid God might hear us. “You’re just on the pity pot,” she says. Oh fuck me. I hate when she talks like this. She started going to Al-anon years ago, when my dad was still alive. Now, she can hardly hold a slogan-free conversation. She sounds like she’s in a cult or some shit. “You know what you need?” she says. “A gratitude list.”\\r\\n“Mom, for chrissake.”\\r\\n“Okay, okay.  Sorry,” she whispers, tiptoeing out to the kitchen, like there’s a sleeping baby in here. Or a bomb.\\r\\nI moved back in with my mom about a couple of weeks ago after Vikki threw me out. Me and Vikki went to couples counseling. Once. One time. I couldn’t take it. I stormed out. The guy wouldn’t let me talk. He kept fuckin’ shushing me, telling me to keep my voice down. Vikki does that all the time, too. She thinks I have a hearing problem and that’s why I talk so loud. But if people would just fuckin’ listen . . .  Anyway, after Dr. Kiplinger shushed me, I said, “If we can’t talk about her meddling parents, then I’m out of here.” And I got up and left. I knew Vikki was gonna be pissed but I didn’t think she’d fucking leave me.\\r\\nThat was around ten a.m. Later, just after lunch, when I went to pick up Frankie from day care, there was Vikki, sitting in the passenger seat of her mother’s Town Car with Frankie, our three-year old, in the child’s seat in the back. I could see his little face, sucking on a sippy cup in his car seat, but I was afraid to go near the car. I didn’t want her mother ganging up on me too. I motioned for Vikki to come over.\\r\\n“Ronnie,” she said, “I’m giving you the weekend to get your stuff out of the house. I want you gone.” She didn’t even seem pissed. Just cold. And even though her mother was still sitting in the car waiting for her and couldn’t even hear what we were saying, I still felt like they were ganging up on me. They always ganged up on me. I think her mom wanted to split us up from the beginning. That’s what I wanted to talk to the couple’s counselor about.  But then it felt like he was ganging up on me, too.\\r\\nI went straight home and packed my shit. Right before I left the house, I called my brother-in-law Brian at work to tell him Vikki and I were getting a divorce. I don’t know, maybe I was hoping he and Lisa would put me up for a while. But he didn’t offer. Shit, he didn’t even sound surprised that Vikki threw me out; it sounded like he already knew all about it, like maybe Vikki’d been talking to her sister about our problems for a while. “Don’t do anything stupid,” Brian said right before I hung up. “That boy needs you.” I bet they were all in on it together, all of them, pushing Vikki to leave me.\\r\\nMy mom’s out in the kitchen now, emptying the dishwasher, it sounds like, and I can still hear her mumbling her Al-anon slogans, some horseshit about “letting go.” Then she calls into the living room to me, “Hey, Ronnie. Why don’t you go pick us up some take-out for us from Sierra’s? That’ll make you feel better.”\\r\\nI say okay and I jump in my Celebrity and drive over to Sierra’s. I place the order at the bar, think about ordering a beer, but instead walk outside to wait, maybe have a smoke. In the strip mall across the parking lot I see this store I’ve never noticed before. It’s called “American Preparedness.” There’s a huge camouflage hummer parked out in front of the shop, with American flags waving from it. I don’t know how I could’ve missed it.\\r\\nI walk over to the shop. The glass door has these red, white, and blue streamers draped over the top corners like it’s the Fourth of July. In the front window there’s flier advertising a course in “Total Home Prep--Surviving Disaster Without Leaving Home” and a sign that says “Grand Opening.” I walk in to take a look around. The lanky guy standing behind the counter nods to me.\\r\\nI stroll in to the middle of the store and say, “’American Preparedness?’ What are you guys preparing for?”\\r\\n“Any and all eventualities,” the guy behind the counter says with complete confidence, like he’s giving a speech. “Financial crises, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, Ebola outbreaks, marauders, you name it.” He walks out from behind the counter and extends his hand. “We’re just trying to keep alive all the know-how our grandparents had. You know, the common sense stuff.” He introduces himself. “Russ.”\\r\\nI shake his hand. “Nice to meet you. I’m Ronnie.” I look around. There are food rations, machines to convert urine into water, gas-powered electrical generators, safes, ammo, firearms, knives like you wouldn’t believe. My grandparents were Canadian. I don’t think they had this kind of know-how.\\r\\n“What can we interest you in today, Ronnie?”\\r\\nThen I get to thinking. I ask for a job application. I stand at the counter and fill it out as Russ and I chat. I finish filling out the application and am just getting ready to leave. Russ looks down at my application. “Ex-military?” he asks. “Hold on just a minute. Let me show your application to Alan,” he says, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb. He walks back through a black curtain behind the counter.\\r\\nI walk around the store. It’s a small shop, cramped really, and packed with stuff. In the corner by the front counter there’s a mannequin in full body armor with a sign that says, “Protecting the Protectors—Together in the Fight.” Across from that, against the wall, are some “Jet Boil Stoves,” whatever those are, and above them a glossy poster advertising “Gourmet Emergency Food” with a woman in the ad who looks just like Marie Osmond. I’m staring at it,  thinking, “It can’t be her, right?” when Russ comes back from behind the curtain with an older gentleman walking behind him. \\r\\n“Hi,” the older guy says. We shake hands. “I’m Alan Sickles. Russ here says you’re interested in coming to work for us Mr. . . . ?” He glances down at my application.\\r\\n“Erbie,” I say. “Ronnie Erbie.  Yes, sir, I am.”\\r\\n“How’d you hear about us?”\\r\\n“Well, I was just picking up some food across the way there and thought I’d take a look.”\\r\\n“Are you familiar with Survivalist culture, Mr. Erbie”?\\r\\n“No, not really. You can call me Ronnie,” I tell him.\\r\\n“Okay, Ronnie.  Well, prior knowledge isn’t essential.  Russ says you’re ex-military?” He looks down at my application again.\\r\\n“Yep. Naval Air. Four years. Active.” \\r\\n“What’d you do in the Navy, Ronnie”?\\r\\n“Power plants. I worked on airplane engines. C-2s. Prop planes. I worked down at Hartsfield, too, for a while when I got out.”\\r\\n“Okay. Well, can you start next week? Why don’t you just come in next Tuesday around three and we’ll get ya started,” Sickles says. “You can be reached at this number?”\\r\\n“Yep.”\\r\\n“Okay,” Sickles says, shaking my hand again, “we’ll see ya Tuesday then. Thanks for coming in.” He walks me toward the front of the store. “And here,” he pulls a little magazine from a display behind me as I open the door of the shop to leave. “Take this with you and have a look.”\\r\\n“Thanks,” I say, curling up the magazine and raising it in the air in a kind of salute toward Russ as I walk out.\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nMe and my mom eat our Sierra’s take-out in front of the TV watching “Celebrity Wife Swap.” Some woman I never heard of who used to be the kid on a sitcom back in the ‘90s is switching families with the wife of some former boy-band member. The families argue about stupid shit, like one of the families is vegetarian or healthy or something and the other one isn’t. I start thinking about Vikki, and about how much she told her family about the problems we were having. I’m pretty sure she told her parents about that time she called the cops on me.\\r\\nSitting there in front of the TV, I start thinking about back when Frankie was really little. I used to get pissed off about how much Vikki was feeding him. It seemed like she nursed him all the time. She’d sit with him up in the glider in our room for what seemed like hours. No way was the kid eating that fucking much. I started thinking that maybe she was always nursing him so she could get away from me.\\r\\nOne night, I insisted on putting Frankie to bed myself. You know, just to get it over with. But he wouldn’t take the bottle. Vikki got all up in my face, telling me to give him to her so she could nurse him. I dropped Frankie on our bed, and I grabbed Vikki by the arms and shoved her backwards out of our bedroom, pushing her down on the floor in the hallway. Then I locked the bedroom door and tried to get Frankie to go to sleep. But he just kept screaming.\\r\\nThen I heard the cops at the front door. Vikki must’ve called them. When I came downstairs holding Frankie, he was all red-faced and beaded with sweat. These two fat cops were standing in the kitchen with Vikki, and she was showing them where I grabbed her. The inside of her arms were all red and blueish, and you could see outlines of my fingers where I’d gripped her. “She bruises really easy,” I told them, but those fucking cops didn’t want to hear my side of anything. Nobody ever--\\r\\n“Ronnie,” I hear my mom say beside me. “You okay?”\\r\\n“I’m fine. Just thinking.”\\r\\nThere’s a commercial on the TV now, so I get up and take our plates out to the kitchen and dump ‘em in the sink. I come back to the couch and tell my mom about the job at American Preparedness. She asks me how much it pays and I just shrug.\\r\\n“You know,” my mom says, “Vikki’ll be real happy you’re working again.” I start yelling that Vikki’s not taking me back and she’s probably gonna make me pay child support and then I’ll never be able to move out of here. My mom starts in again with her bullshit about counting blessings and putting something or other in my “god box,” whatever the hell that is. That’s when I say I’m going to bed.\\r\\nI lie down on the sofa in the little room where my mom’s letting me stay. It’s her sewing room. There’s a sewing machine near the closet and a tackle box full of little scissors, needles, spools of thread, and what she calls her “fat quarters” sitting on the end table. On the wall there’s a picture frame and inside it, written in baby-blue yarn, it says, “Life is hard by the yard, but by the inch it’s a cinch.”\\r\\nI’m not really tired so I just lay back and smoke a cigarette. My mom doesn’t want me smoking in her house, so I crack the window, and flick my ashes in a coke can I keep on the floor beside the couch. I start flipping through the magazine Mr. Sickles gave me.\\r\\n“The New Patriot” it’s called.  It’s kind of like a newsletter. There’s a column entitled “The Sword and the Covenant” and articles about “prepper” culture and something called “Posse Comitatus.” I don’t read the articles though, just look at the pictures. There’s all this cool stuff, ads for “Home Defense Fundamentals,” all kinds of camping gear, and an ad for food that boasts a “25-Year Shelf Life!” The ads reminds me of when I was a kid and I’d come across those cool ads at the end of comic books for stuff like the “10-in-One Optical Device,” the “Mess Kit/Canteen Combo,” or, my favorite, the “X-Ray Vision” glasses that promised you could see through clothes or even skin. (“Amaze and embarrass everyone!” the ad said). But I never ordered any of that stuff. I’d just sit and look at the ads for the x-ray glasses or for the hypnotist lessons, daydreaming about the ads more than I read the comics. \\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI show up at the American Preparedness store a little before three on Tuesday, like Mr. Sickles told me to. I wear khakis and a button-down denim shirt I got at Target, trying to look like Mr. Sickles and Russ. Mr. Sickles wears those brown loafers with tassels on them. Girl shoes, I call them. I don’t wear those. I wear my black Reeboks like I used to wear when I worked at the airport. They look like dress shoes if you don’t look too close. Russ wears hiking boots.\\r\\nMr. Sickles has me fill out some forms, and then he has Russ show me around the shop. There’s a lot of cool stuff, like a “Pandemic Flu Kit,” a big squirt bottle of yellowish liquid labeled “Fire Suppressor,” and fully stocked backpacks, stuffed with flashlights, light sticks, a compass, a poncho, waterproof matches, and even a kids coloring book.\\r\\nThe coloring book starts me thinking about Frankie, about how much he’d enjoy the scouting equipment and camping gear. That day I talked to my brother-in-law, the day Vikki kicked me out, he said, “That boy needs you.” And I start thinking that maybe he’s right. I mean, that’s what people are always saying, aren’t they? That kids need their fathers? Especially boys. Maybe that’s just what Frankie and I need, a little father-son weekend, a camping trip. Maybe some fishing. But Vikki’ll never go for it. She can be such a bitch. I can just hear her now. “Ronnie, he’s only three years old. It’s September!” He’s my fucking kid too, though.\\r\\nAround seven o’clock I take my break. Mr. Sickles has already gone home, so it’s just me and Russ. I go out back for a smoke. Russ comes out too for a minute, and I tell him I want to get some of this cool shit that the store has.\\r\\n“Oh, Alan’s real cool about that,” he says. “He lets you take stuff on credit.”\\r\\nMan, I’d sure like to get one of those backpacks, and maybe a little stove. Maybe I could take Frankie up to Tallulah Falls. \\r\\nI get home from work about nine thirty. My mom’s still up, sitting on the couch watching “America’s Got Talent” or something.  I go into the kitchen and call Vikki.\\r\\n“Hey, Vik,” I say when she picks up. “How’s Frankie?”\\r\\nShe starts right in with the bitching about child support and then I tell her about my new job and how I want to take Frankie camping on Saturday.\\r\\nShe doesn’t say anything at all. For a second I thought maybe she hung up or we got disconnected.  Then she just says, “Ronnie,” sounding all exasperated, like she has a headache or something. Like I’m some big headache when all I wanna do is spend some time with my son. “Quality time,” they call it, right? And I’m saying this and she’s not saying anything. It’s like she runs out of things to say.  Then she says, “no.” and I ask her why and she just says “because I said so” like I’m some fucking kid.  “Well, we see about that,” I’m about to say, but she’s already hung up.\\r\\nI slam down the phone and walk out to the living room. My mom’s still sitting on the couch. She asks what’s wrong. “Nothing,” I say. “Fucking Vikki,” I say to myself. “I don’t want to talk about it.”\\r\\n“Q-tip,” she says.\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n“Q-tip. Quit. Taking. It. Personally.”\\r\\n“Oh, for fuck’s sake. I’m going to bed.”\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI pack up the Celebrity with some old camping gear. I throw in the new backpack and little stove that Mr. Sickles let me take from the store after my third week. I also pack the Lightning McQueen lantern I got for Frankie at Target and the animal crackers and juice boxes that I bought. Then I drive over to Vikki’s house.\\r\\nIt’s Friday afternoon. I’m going to pick up Frankie and bring him back to my mom’s to spend the night. That way, he can spend some time with his grandma, and then he and I can get an early start tomorrow. I’ve timed it so I’ll get to Vikki’s right around the time I know she’s getting home from work. Surprise her. I want to catch her outside. Talk to her a minute. Show her the stuff I got, how much thought I put into this trip. If I don’t get there before her and she’s already in the house, she might just pretend she’s not home or not let me in. But I’m taking him. He’s my kid too. Even my mom said that. \\r\\nI wait down the street in my car until I see her SUV pull up in the driveway. She pulls in the garage, and I get out of my car and start walking toward the house. I walk up the driveway and see Vikki. She’s lifting Frankie out of his car seat. She hears me walking up and looks up. Then she ducks her head right back into the car to grab Frankie. I can already tell she’s not happy to see me. \\r\\nShe pokes her head out of the car’s back door again as I approach. She’s still messing with the car seat. “Ronnie, what are you doing here--. No,” she says. “No Ronnie. “ I push her out of the way so I can grab Frankie from the backseat. I hear her fall backwards onto some cardboard boxes that are sitting on the floor of the garage against the wall.\\r\\n“Goddammit, Ronnie.”\\r\\n“He’s my kid too,” I scream. “Hey Frank,” I say, turning and bending down to look in the backseat. “Daddy’s gonna take you camping.  Wanna go camping with daddy?”\\r\\nHe looks happy to see me, I guess, but he looks a little scared too. He’ll calm down once we get on the road. I try lifting him out of the car seat but I guess one of his seatbelts is still buckled. I crouch down to take a closer look. Then I feel this crushing pain on the back of my head and I drop down onto the floor of the garage. Jesus Christ! What the fuck? I think I’m bleeding. Did she just hit me with a shovel? I lay down on my back, stretch my legs out under Vikki’s Range Rover. I look up at the ceiling and see a naked light bulb, gleaming in the darkness. Pain shoots down the top of my head and down my spine and through my jaw. Then I get this overwhelming smell of grape jelly, for some reason.  \r\nI’m lying there on my back, and Vikki steps over me and grabs Frankie. She carries him out of the garage. I can hear her keys jangling over the sound of Frankie screaming. Then I hear her go in the house and slam the door. She’s probably gonna call the police. I just lay there, staring up at the lightbulb wondering what I ever did to deserve all this. The whole goddamn universe is out to get me. I better get outta here before the cops come. But I can’t move just yet. I stare up at the lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, and it starts to flicker.

(462, 1, '2016-07-29 10:20:19', '2016-07-29 18:20:19', 'I must be fucking cursed. \\r\\nGod’s punishing me. He always has. That’s why things come so easy to everybody else and why I have to fight like hell to just hold on to the little I got.\\r\\n“You shouldn’t talk like that,” my mother says. She whispers it, like she’s afraid God might hear us. “You’re just on the pity pot,” she says. Oh fuck me. I hate when she talks like this. She started going to Al-anon years ago, when my dad was still alive. Now, she can hardly hold a slogan-free conversation. She sounds like she’s in a cult or some shit. “You know what you need?” she says. “A gratitude list.”\\r\\n“Mom, for chrissake.”\\r\\n“Okay, okay.  Sorry,” she whispers, tiptoeing out to the kitchen, like there’s a sleeping baby in here. Or a bomb.\\r\\nI moved back in with my mom about a couple of weeks ago after Vikki threw me out. Me and Vikki went to couples counseling. Once. One time. I couldn’t take it. I stormed out. The guy wouldn’t let me talk. He kept fuckin’ shushing me, telling me to keep my voice down. Vikki does that all the time, too. She thinks I have a hearing problem and that’s why I talk so loud. But if people would just fuckin’ listen . . .  Anyway, after Dr. Kiplinger shushed me, I said, “If we can’t talk about her meddling parents, then I’m out of here.” And I got up and left. I knew Vikki was gonna be pissed but I didn’t think she’d fucking leave me.\\r\\nThat was around ten a.m. Later, just after lunch, when I went to pick up Frankie from day care, there was Vikki, sitting in the passenger seat of her mother’s Town Car with Frankie, our three-year old, in the child’s seat in the back. I could see his little face, sucking on a sippy cup in his car seat, but I was afraid to go near the car. I didn’t want her mother ganging up on me too. I motioned for Vikki to come over.\\r\\n“Ronnie,” she said, “I’m giving you the weekend to get your stuff out of the house. I want you gone.” She didn’t even seem pissed. Just cold. And even though her mother was still sitting in the car waiting for her and couldn’t even hear what we were saying, I still felt like they were ganging up on me. They always ganged up on me. I think her mom wanted to split us up from the beginning. That’s what I wanted to talk to the couple’s counselor about.  But then it felt like he was ganging up on me, too.\\r\\nI went straight home and packed my shit. Right before I left the house, I called my brother-in-law Brian at work to tell him Vikki and I were getting a divorce. I don’t know, maybe I was hoping he and Lisa would put me up for a while. But he didn’t offer. Shit, he didn’t even sound surprised that Vikki threw me out; it sounded like he already knew all about it, like maybe Vikki’d been talking to her sister about our problems for a while. “Don’t do anything stupid,” Brian said right before I hung up. “That boy needs you.” I bet they were all in on it together, all of them, pushing Vikki to leave me.\\r\\nMy mom’s out in the kitchen now, emptying the dishwasher, it sounds like, and I can still hear her mumbling her Al-anon slogans, some horseshit about “letting go.” Then she calls into the living room to me, “Hey, Ronnie. Why don’t you go pick us up some take-out for us from Sierra’s? That’ll make you feel better.”\\r\\nI say okay and I jump in my Celebrity and drive over to Sierra’s. I place the order at the bar, think about ordering a beer, but instead walk outside to wait, maybe have a smoke. In the strip mall across the parking lot I see this store I’ve never noticed before. It’s called “American Preparedness.” There’s a huge camouflage hummer parked out in front of the shop, with American flags waving from it. I don’t know how I could’ve missed it.\\r\\nI walk over to the shop. The glass door has these red, white, and blue streamers draped over the top corners like it’s the Fourth of July. In the front window there’s flier advertising a course in “Total Home Prep--Surviving Disaster Without Leaving Home” and a sign that says “Grand Opening.” I walk in to take a look around. The lanky guy standing behind the counter nods to me.\\r\\nI stroll in to the middle of the store and say, “’American Preparedness?’ What are you guys preparing for?”\\r\\n“Any and all eventualities,” the guy behind the counter says with complete confidence, like he’s giving a speech. “Financial crises, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, Ebola outbreaks, marauders, you name it.” He walks out from behind the counter and extends his hand. “We’re just trying to keep alive all the know-how our grandparents had. You know, the common sense stuff.” He introduces himself. “Russ.”\\r\\nI shake his hand. “Nice to meet you. I’m Ronnie.” I look around. There are food rations, machines to convert urine into water, gas-powered electrical generators, safes, ammo, firearms, knives like you wouldn’t believe. My grandparents were Canadian. I don’t think they had this kind of know-how.\\r\\n“What can we interest you in today, Ronnie?”\\r\\nThen I get to thinking. I ask for a job application. I stand at the counter and fill it out as Russ and I chat. I finish filling out the application and am just getting ready to leave. Russ looks down at my application. “Ex-military?” he asks. “Hold on just a minute. Let me show your application to Alan,” he says, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb. He walks back through a black curtain behind the counter.\\r\\nI walk around the store. It’s a small shop, cramped really, and packed with stuff. In the corner by the front counter there’s a mannequin in full body armor with a sign that says, “Protecting the Protectors—Together in the Fight.” Across from that, against the wall, are some “Jet Boil Stoves,” whatever those are, and above them a glossy poster advertising “Gourmet Emergency Food” with a woman in the ad who looks just like Marie Osmond. I’m staring at it,  thinking, “It can’t be her, right?” when Russ comes back from behind the curtain with an older gentleman walking behind him. \\r\\n“Hi,” the older guy says. We shake hands. “I’m Alan Sickles. Russ here says you’re interested in coming to work for us Mr. . . . ?” He glances down at my application.\\r\\n“Erbie,” I say. “Ronnie Erbie.  Yes, sir, I am.”\\r\\n“How’d you hear about us?”\\r\\n“Well, I was just picking up some food across the way there and thought I’d take a look.”\\r\\n“Are you familiar with Survivalist culture, Mr. Erbie”?\\r\\n“No, not really. You can call me Ronnie,” I tell him.\\r\\n“Okay, Ronnie.  Well, prior knowledge isn’t essential.  Russ says you’re ex-military?” He looks down at my application again.\\r\\n“Yep. Naval Air. Four years. Active.” \\r\\n“What’d you do in the Navy, Ronnie”?\\r\\n“Power plants. I worked on airplane engines. C-2s. Prop planes. I worked down at Hartsfield, too, for a while when I got out.”\\r\\n“Okay. Well, can you start next week? Why don’t you just come in next Tuesday around three and we’ll get ya started,” Sickles says. “You can be reached at this number?”\\r\\n“Yep.”\\r\\n“Okay,” Sickles says, shaking my hand again, “we’ll see ya Tuesday then. Thanks for coming in.” He walks me toward the front of the store. “And here,” he pulls a little magazine from a display behind me as I open the door of the shop to leave. “Take this with you and have a look.”\\r\\n“Thanks,” I say, curling up the magazine and raising it in the air in a kind of salute toward Russ as I walk out.\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nMe and my mom eat our Sierra’s take-out in front of the TV watching “Celebrity Wife Swap.” Some woman I never heard of who used to be the kid on a sitcom back in the ‘90s is switching families with the wife of some former boy-band member. The families argue about stupid shit, like one of the families is vegetarian or healthy or something and the other one isn’t. I start thinking about Vikki, and about how much she told her family about the problems we were having. I’m pretty sure she told her parents about that time she called the cops on me.\\r\\nSitting there in front of the TV, I start thinking about back when Frankie was really little. I used to get pissed off about how much Vikki was feeding him. It seemed like she nursed him all the time. She’d sit with him up in the glider in our room for what seemed like hours. No way was the kid eating that fucking much. I started thinking that maybe she was always nursing him so she could get away from me.\\r\\nOne night, I insisted on putting Frankie to bed myself. You know, just to get it over with. But he wouldn’t take the bottle. Vikki got all up in my face, telling me to give him to her so she could nurse him. I dropped Frankie on our bed, and I grabbed Vikki by the arms and shoved her backwards out of our bedroom, pushing her down on the floor in the hallway. Then I locked the bedroom door and tried to get Frankie to go to sleep. But he just kept screaming.\\r\\nThen I heard the cops at the front door. Vikki must’ve called them. When I came downstairs holding Frankie, he was all red-faced and beaded with sweat. These two fat cops were standing in the kitchen with Vikki, and she was showing them where I grabbed her. The inside of her arms were all red and blueish, and you could see outlines of my fingers where I’d gripped her. “She bruises really easy,” I told them, but those fucking cops didn’t want to hear my side of anything. Nobody ever--\\r\\n“Ronnie,” I hear my mom say beside me. “You okay?”\\r\\n“I’m fine. Just thinking.”\\r\\nThere’s a commercial on the TV now, so I get up and take our plates out to the kitchen and dump ‘em in the sink. I come back to the couch and tell my mom about the job at American Preparedness. She asks me how much it pays and I just shrug.\\r\\n“You know,” my mom says, “Vikki’ll be real happy you’re working again.” I start yelling that Vikki’s not taking me back and she’s probably gonna make me pay child support and then I’ll never be able to move out of here. My mom starts in again with her bullshit about counting blessings and putting something or other in my “god box,” whatever the hell that is. That’s when I say I’m going to bed.\\r\\nI lie down on the sofa in the little room where my mom’s letting me stay. It’s her sewing room. There’s a sewing machine near the closet and a tackle box full of little scissors, needles, spools of thread, and what she calls her “fat quarters” sitting on the end table. On the wall there’s a picture frame and inside it, written in baby-blue yarn, it says, “Life is hard by the yard, but by the inch it’s a cinch.”\\r\\nI’m not really tired so I just lay back and smoke a cigarette. My mom doesn’t want me smoking in her house, so I crack the window, and flick my ashes in a coke can I keep on the floor beside the couch. I start flipping through the magazine Mr. Sickles gave me.\\r\\n“The New Patriot” it’s called.  It’s kind of like a newsletter. There’s a column entitled “The Sword and the Covenant” and articles about “prepper” culture and something called “Posse Comitatus.” I don’t read the articles though, just look at the pictures. There’s all this cool stuff, ads for “Home Defense Fundamentals,” all kinds of camping gear, and an ad for food that boasts a “25-Year Shelf Life!” The ads reminds me of when I was a kid and I’d come across those cool ads at the end of comic books for stuff like the “10-in-One Optical Device,” the “Mess Kit/Canteen Combo,” or, my favorite, the “X-Ray Vision” glasses that promised you could see through clothes or even skin. (“Amaze and embarrass everyone!” the ad said). But I never ordered any of that stuff. I’d just sit and look at the ads for the x-ray glasses or for the hypnotist lessons, daydreaming about the ads more than I read the comics. \\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI show up at the American Preparedness store a little before three on Tuesday, like Mr. Sickles told me to. I wear khakis and a button-down denim shirt I got at Target, trying to look like Mr. Sickles and Russ. Mr. Sickles wears those brown loafers with tassels on them. Girl shoes, I call them. I don’t wear those. I wear my black Reeboks like I used to wear when I worked at the airport. They look like dress shoes if you don’t look too close. Russ wears hiking boots.\\r\\nMr. Sickles has me fill out some forms, and then he has Russ show me around the shop. There’s a lot of cool stuff, like a “Pandemic Flu Kit,” a big squirt bottle of yellowish liquid labeled “Fire Suppressor,” and fully stocked backpacks, stuffed with flashlights, light sticks, a compass, a poncho, waterproof matches, and even a kids coloring book.\\r\\nThe coloring book starts me thinking about Frankie, about how much he’d enjoy the scouting equipment and camping gear. That day I talked to my brother-in-law, the day Vikki kicked me out, he said, “That boy needs you.” And I start thinking that maybe he’s right. I mean, that’s what people are always saying, aren’t they? That kids need their fathers? Especially boys. Maybe that’s just what Frankie and I need, a little father-son weekend, a camping trip. Maybe some fishing. But Vikki’ll never go for it. She can be such a bitch. I can just hear her now. “Ronnie, he’s only three years old. It’s September!” He’s my fucking kid too, though.\\r\\nAround seven o’clock I take my break. Mr. Sickles has already gone home, so it’s just me and Russ. I go out back for a smoke. Russ comes out too for a minute, and I tell him I want to get some of this cool shit that the store has.\\r\\n“Oh, Alan’s real cool about that,” he says. “He lets you take stuff on credit.”\\r\\nMan, I’d sure like to get one of those backpacks, and maybe a little stove. Maybe I could take Frankie up to Tallulah Falls. \\r\\nI get home from work about nine thirty. My mom’s still up, sitting on the couch watching “America’s Got Talent” or something.  I go into the kitchen and call Vikki.\\r\\n“Hey, Vik,” I say when she picks up. “How’s Frankie?”\\r\\nShe starts right in with the bitching about child support and then I tell her about my new job and how I want to take Frankie camping on Saturday.\\r\\nShe doesn’t say anything at all. For a second I thought maybe she hung up or we got disconnected.  Then she just says, “Ronnie,” sounding all exasperated, like she has a headache or something. Like I’m some big headache when all I wanna do is spend some time with my son. “Quality time,” they call it, right? And I’m saying this and she’s not saying anything. It’s like she runs out of things to say.  Then she says, “no.” and I ask her why and she just says “because I said so” like I’m some fucking kid.  “Well, we see about that,” I’m about to say, but she’s already hung up.\\r\\nI slam down the phone and walk out to the living room. My mom’s still sitting on the couch. She asks what’s wrong. “Nothing,” I say. “Fucking Vikki,” I say to myself. “I don’t want to talk about it.”\\r\\n“Q-tip,” she says.\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n“Q-tip. Quit. Taking. It. Personally.”\\r\\n“Oh, for fuck’s sake. I’m going to bed.”\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI pack up the Celebrity with some old camping gear. I throw in the new backpack and little stove that Mr. Sickles let me take from the store after my third week. I also pack the Lightning McQueen lantern I got for Frankie at Target and the animal crackers and juice boxes that I bought. Then I drive over to Vikki’s house.\\r\\nIt’s Friday afternoon. I’m going to pick up Frankie and bring him back to my mom’s to spend the night. That way, he can spend some time with his grandma, and then he and I can get an early start tomorrow. I’ve timed it so I’ll get to Vikki’s right around the time I know she’s getting home from work. Surprise her. I want to catch her outside. Talk to her a minute. Show her the stuff I got, how much thought I put into this trip. If I don’t get there before her and she’s already in the house, she might just pretend she’s not home or not let me in. But I’m taking him. He’s my kid too. Even my mom said that. \\r\\nI wait down the street in my car until I see her SUV pull up in the driveway. She pulls in the garage, and I get out of my car and start walking toward the house. I walk up the driveway and see Vikki. She’s lifting Frankie out of his car seat. She hears me walking up and looks up. Then she ducks her head right back into the car to grab Frankie. I can already tell she’s not happy to see me. \\r\\nShe pokes her head out of the car’s back door again as I approach. She’s still messing with the car seat. “Ronnie, what are you doing here--. No,” she says. “No Ronnie. “ I push her out of the way so I can grab Frankie from the backseat. I hear her fall backwards onto some cardboard boxes that are sitting on the floor of the garage against the wall.\\r\\n“Goddammit, Ronnie.”\\r\\n“He’s my kid too,” I scream. “Hey Frank,” I say, turning and bending down to look in the backseat. “Daddy’s gonna take you camping.  Wanna go camping with daddy?”\\r\\nHe looks happy to see me, I guess, but he looks a little scared too. He’ll calm down once we get on the road. I try lifting him out of the car seat but I guess one of his seatbelts is still buckled. I crouch down to take a closer look. Then I feel this crushing pain on the back of my head and I drop down onto the floor of the garage. Jesus Christ! What the fuck? I think I’m bleeding. Did she just hit me with a shovel? I lay down on my back, stretch my legs out under Vikki’s Range Rover. I look up at the ceiling and see a naked light bulb, gleaming in the darkness. Pain shoots down the top of my head and down my spine and through my jaw. Then I get this overwhelming smell of grape jelly, for some reason.  \r\nI’m lying there on my back, and Vikki steps over me and grabs Frankie. She carries him out of the garage. I can hear her keys jangling over the sound of Frankie screaming. Then I hear her go in the house and slam the door. She’s probably gonna call the police. I just lay there, staring up at the lightbulb wondering what I ever did to deserve all this. The whole goddamn universe is out to get me. I better get outta here before the cops come. But I can’t move just yet. I stare up at the lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, and it starts to flicker.

Vikki does that all the time, too. She thinks I have a hearing problem and that’s why I talk so loud. But if people would just fuckin’ listen . . .  Anyway, after Dr. Kiplinger shushed me, I said, “If we can’t talk about her meddling parents, then I’m out of here.” And I got up and left. I knew Vikki was gonna be pissed but I didn’t think she’d fucking leave me.\\r\\nThat was around ten a.m. Later, just after lunch, when I went to pick up Frankie from day care, there was Vikki, sitting in the passenger seat of her mother’s Town Car with Frankie, our three-year old, in the child’s seat in the back. I could see his little face, sucking on a sippy cup in his car seat, but I was afraid to go near the car. I didn’t want her mother ganging up on me too. I motioned for Vikki to come over.\\r\\n            “Ronnie,” she said, “I’m giving you the weekend to get your stuff out of the house. I want you gone.” She didn’t even seem pissed. Just cold. And even though her mother was still sitting in the car waiting for her and couldn’t even hear what we were saying, I still felt like they were ganging up on me. They always ganged up on me. I think her mom wanted to split us up from the beginning. That’s what I wanted to talk to the couple’s counselor about.  But then it felt like he was ganging up on me, too.\\r\\n            I went straight home and packed my shit. Right before I left the house, I called my brother-in-law Brian at work to tell him Vikki and I were getting a divorce. I don’t know, maybe I was hoping he and Lisa would put me up for a while. But he didn’t offer. Shit, he didn’t even sound surprised that Vikki threw me out; it sounded like he already knew all about it, like maybe Vikki’d been talking to her sister about our problems for a while. “Don’t do anything stupid,” Brian said right before I hung up. “That boy needs you.” I bet they were all in on it together, all of them, pushing Vikki to leave me.\\r\\n            My mom’s out in the kitchen now, emptying the dishwasher, it sounds like, and I can still hear her mumbling her Al-anon slogans, some horseshit about “letting go.” Then she calls into the living room to me, “Hey, Ronnie. Why don’t you go pick us up some take-out for us from Sierra’s? That’ll make you feel better.”\\r\\n            I say okay and I jump in my Celebrity and drive over to Sierra’s. I place the order at the bar, think about ordering a beer, but instead walk outside to wait, maybe have a smoke. In the strip mall across the parking lot I see this store I’ve never noticed before. It’s called “American Preparedness.” There’s a huge camouflage hummer parked out in front of the shop, with American flags waving from it. I don’t know how I could’ve missed it.\\r\\nI walk over to the shop. The glass door has these red, white, and blue streamers draped over the top corners like it’s the Fourth of July. In the front window there’s flier advertising a course in “Total Home Prep--Surviving Disaster Without Leaving Home” and a sign that says “Grand Opening.” I walk in to take a look around. The lanky guy standing behind the counter nods to me.\\r\\n            I stroll in to the middle of the store and say, “’American Preparedness?’ What are you guys preparing for?”\\r\\n            “Any and all eventualities,” the guy behind the counter says with complete confidence, like he’s giving a speech. “Financial crises, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, Ebola outbreaks, marauders, you name it.” He walks out from behind the counter and extends his hand. “We’re just trying to keep alive all the know-how our grandparents had. You know, the common sense stuff.” He introduces himself. “Russ.”\\r\\nI shake his hand. “Nice to meet you. I’m Ronnie.” I look around. There are food rations, machines to convert urine into water, gas-powered electrical generators, safes, ammo, firearms, knives like you wouldn’t believe. My grandparents were Canadian. I don’t think they had this kind of know-how.\\r\\n             “What can we interest you in today, Ronnie?”\\r\\nThen I get to thinking. I ask for a job application. I stand at the counter and fill it out as Russ and I chat. I finish filling out the application and am just getting ready to leave. Russ looks down at my application. “Ex-military?” he asks. “Hold on just a minute. Let me show your application to Alan,” he says, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb. He walks back through a black curtain behind the counter.\\r\\nI walk around the store. It’s a small shop, cramped really, and packed with stuff. In the corner by the front counter there’s a mannequin in full body armor with a sign that says, “Protecting the Protectors—Together in the Fight.” Across from that, against the wall, are some “Jet Boil Stoves,” whatever those are, and above them a glossy poster advertising “Gourmet Emergency Food” with a woman in the ad who looks just like Marie Osmond. I’m staring at it,  thinking, “It can’t be her, right?” when Russ comes back from behind the curtain with an older gentleman walking behind him. \\r\\n            “Hi,” the older guy says. We shake hands. “I’m Alan Sickles. Russ here says you’re interested in coming to work for us Mr. . . . ?” He glances down at my application.\\r\\n            “Erbie,” I say. “Ronnie Erbie.  Yes, sir, I am.”\\r\\n            “How’d you hear about us?”\\r\\n            “Well, I was just picking up some food across the way there and thought I’d take a look.”\\r\\n            “Are you familiar with Survivalist culture, Mr. Erbie”?\\r\\n            “No, not really. You can call me Ronnie,” I tell him.\\r\\n            “Okay, Ronnie.  Well, prior knowledge isn’t essential.  Russ says you’re ex-military?” He looks down at my application again.\\r\\n            “Yep. Naval Air. Four years. Active.” \\r\\n            “What’d you do in the Navy, Ronnie”?\\r\\n            “Power plants. I worked on airplane engines. C-2s. Prop planes. I worked down at Hartsfield, too, for a while when I got out.”\\r\\n            “Okay. Well, can you start next week? Why don’t you just come in next Tuesday around three and we’ll get ya started,” Sickles says. “You can be reached at this number?”\\r\\n            “Yep.”\\r\\n            “Okay,” Sickles says, shaking my hand again, “we’ll see ya Tuesday then. Thanks for coming in.” He walks me toward the front of the store. “And here,” he pulls a little magazine from a display behind me as I open the door of the shop to leave. “Take this with you and have a look.”\\r\\n            “Thanks,” I say, curling up the magazine and raising it in the air in a kind of salute toward Russ as I walk out.\\r\\n#\\r\\nMe and my mom eat our Sierra’s take-out in front of the TV watching “Celebrity Wife Swap.” Some woman I never heard of who used to be the kid on a sitcom back in the ‘90s is switching families with the wife of some former boy-band member. The families argue about stupid shit, like one of the families is vegetarian or healthy or something and the other one isn’t. I start thinking about Vikki, and about how much she told her family about the problems we were having. I’m pretty sure she told her parents about that time she called the cops on me.\\r\\nSitting there in front of the TV, I start thinking about back when Frankie was really little. I used to get pissed off about how much Vikki was feeding him. It seemed like she nursed him all the time. She’d sit with him up in the glider in our room for what seemed like hours. No way was the kid eating that fucking much. I started thinking that maybe she was always nursing him so she could get away from me.\\r\\nOne night, I insisted on putting Frankie to bed myself. You know, just to get it over with. But he wouldn’t take the bottle. Vikki got all up in my face, telling me to give him to her so she could nurse him. I dropped Frankie on our bed, and I grabbed Vikki by the arms and shoved her backwards out of our bedroom, pushing her down on the floor in the hallway. Then I locked the bedroom door and tried to get Frankie to go to sleep. But he just kept screaming.\\r\\nThen I heard the cops at the front door. Vikki must’ve called them. When I came downstairs holding Frankie, he was all red-faced and beaded with sweat. These two fat cops were standing in the kitchen with Vikki, and she was showing them where I grabbed her. The inside of her arms were all red and blueish, and you could see outlines of my fingers where I’d gripped her. “She bruises really easy,” I told them, but those fucking cops didn’t want to hear my side of anything. Nobody ever--\\r\\n“Ronnie,” I hear my mom say beside me. “You okay?”\\r\\n“I’m fine. Just thinking.”\\r\\nThere’s a commercial on the TV now, so I get up and take our plates out to the kitchen and dump ‘em in the sink. I come back to the couch and tell my mom about the job at American Preparedness. She asks me how much it pays and I just shrug.\\r\\n“You know,” my mom says, “Vikki’ll be real happy you’re working again.” I start yelling that Vikki’s not taking me back and she’s probably gonna make me pay child support and then I’ll never be able to move out of here. My mom starts in again with her bullshit about counting blessings and putting something or other in my “god box,” whatever the hell that is. That’s when I say I’m going to bed.\\r\\nI lie down on the sofa in the little room where my mom’s letting me stay. It’s her sewing room. There’s a sewing machine near the closet and a tackle box full of little scissors, needles, spools of thread, and what she calls her “fat quarters” sitting on the end table. On the wall there’s a picture frame and inside it, written in baby-blue yarn, it says, “Life is hard by the yard, but by the inch it’s a cinch.”\\r\\nI’m not really tired so I just lay back and smoke a cigarette. My mom doesn’t want me smoking in her house, so I crack the window, and flick my ashes in a coke can I keep on the floor beside the couch. I start flipping through the magazine Mr. Sickles gave me.\\r\\n“The New Patriot” it’s called.  It’s kind of like a newsletter. There’s a column entitled “The Sword and the Covenant” and articles about “prepper” culture and something called “Posse Comitatus.” I don’t read the articles though, just look at the pictures. There’s all this cool stuff, ads for “Home Defense Fundamentals,” all kinds of camping gear, and an ad for food that boasts a “25-Year Shelf Life!” The ads reminds me of when I was a kid and I’d come across those cool ads at the end of comic books for stuff like the “10-in-One Optical Device,” the “Mess Kit/Canteen Combo,” or, my favorite, the “X-Ray Vision” glasses that promised you could see through clothes or even skin. (“Amaze and embarrass everyone!” the ad said). But I never ordered any of that stuff. I’d just sit and look at the ads for the x-ray glasses or for the hypnotist lessons, daydreaming about the ads more than I read the comics. \\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI show up at the American Preparedness store a little before three on Tuesday, like Mr. Sickles told me to. I wear khakis and a button-down denim shirt I got at Target, trying to look like Mr. Sickles and Russ. Mr. Sickles wears those brown loafers with tassels on them. Girl shoes, I call them. I don’t wear those. I wear my black Reeboks like I used to wear when I worked at the airport. They look like dress shoes if you don’t look too close. Russ wears hiking boots.\\r\\nMr. Sickles has me fill out some forms, and then he has Russ show me around the shop. There’s a lot of cool stuff, like a “Pandemic Flu Kit,” a big squirt bottle of yellowish liquid labeled “Fire Suppressor,” and fully stocked backpacks, stuffed with flashlights, light sticks, a compass, a poncho, waterproof matches, and even a kids coloring book.\\r\\nThe coloring book starts me thinking about Frankie, about how much he’d enjoy the scouting equipment and camping gear. That day I talked to my brother-in-law, the day Vikki kicked me out, he said, “That boy needs you.” And I start thinking that maybe he’s right. I mean, that’s what people are always saying, aren’t they? That kids need their fathers? Especially boys. Maybe that’s just what Frankie and I need, a little father-son weekend, a camping trip. Maybe some fishing. But Vikki’ll never go for it. She can be such a bitch. I can just hear her now. “Ronnie, he’s only three years old. It’s September!” He’s my fucking kid too, though.\\r\\nAround seven o’clock I take my break. Mr. Sickles has already gone home, so it’s just me and Russ. I go out back for a smoke. Russ comes out too for a minute, and I tell him I want to get some of this cool shit that the store has.\\r\\n“Oh, Alan’s real cool about that,” he says. “He lets you take stuff on credit.”\\r\\nMan, I’d sure like to get one of those backpacks, and maybe a little stove. Maybe I could take Frankie up to Tallulah Falls. \\r\\nI get home from work about nine thirty. My mom’s still up, sitting on the couch watching “America’s Got Talent” or something.  I go into the kitchen and call Vikki.\\r\\n“Hey, Vik,” I say when she picks up. “How’s Frankie?”\\r\\nShe starts right in with the bitching about child support and then I tell her about my new job and how I want to take Frankie camping on Saturday.\\r\\nShe doesn’t say anything at all. For a second I thought maybe she hung up or we got disconnected.  Then she just says, “Ronnie,” sounding all exasperated, like she has a headache or something. Like I’m some big headache when all I wanna do is spend some time with my son. “Quality time,” they call it, right? And I’m saying this and she’s not saying anything. It’s like she runs out of things to say.  Then she says, “no.” and I ask her why and she just says “because I said so” like I’m some fucking kid.  “Well, we see about that,” I’m about to say, but she’s already hung up.\\r\\nI slam down the phone and walk out to the living room. My mom’s still sitting on the couch. She asks what’s wrong. “Nothing,” I say. “Fucking Vikki,” I say to myself. “I don’t want to talk about it.”\\r\\n“Q-tip,” she says.\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n“Q-tip. Quit. Taking. It. Personally.”\\r\\n“Oh, for fuck’s sake. I’m going to bed.”\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI pack up the Celebrity with some old camping gear. I throw in the new backpack and little stove that Mr. Sickles let me take from the store after my third week. I also pack the Lightning McQueen lantern I got for Frankie at Target and the animal crackers and juice boxes that I bought. Then I drive over to Vikki’s house.\\r\\nIt’s Friday afternoon. I’m going to pick up Frankie and bring him back to my mom’s to spend the night. That way, he can spend some time with his grandma, and then he and I can get an early start tomorrow. I’ve timed it so I’ll get to Vikki’s right around the time I know she’s getting home from work. Surprise her. I want to catch her outside. Talk to her a minute. Show her the stuff I got, how much thought I put into this trip. If I don’t get there before her and she’s already in the house, she might just pretend she’s not home or not let me in. But I’m taking him. He’s my kid too. Even my mom said that. \\r\\nI wait down the street in my car until I see her SUV pull up in the driveway. She pulls in the garage, and I get out of my car and start walking toward the house. I walk up the driveway and see Vikki. She’s lifting Frankie out of his car seat. She hears me walking up and looks up. Then she ducks her head right back into the car to grab Frankie. I can already tell she’s not happy to see me. \\r\\nShe pokes her head out of the car’s back door again as I approach. She’s still messing with the car seat. “Ronnie, what are you doing here--. No,” she says. “No Ronnie. “ I push her out of the way so I can grab Frankie from the backseat. I hear her fall backwards onto some cardboard boxes that are sitting on the floor of the garage against the wall.\\r\\n“Goddammit, Ronnie.”\\r\\n“He’s my kid too,” I scream. “Hey Frank,” I say, turning and bending down to look in the backseat. “Daddy’s gonna take you camping.  Wanna go camping with daddy?”\\r\\nHe looks happy to see me, I guess, but he looks a little scared too. He’ll calm down once we get on the road. I try lifting him out of the car seat but I guess one of his seatbelts is still buckled. I crouch down to take a closer look. Then I feel this crushing pain on the back of my head and I drop down onto the floor of the garage. Jesus Christ! What the fuck? I think I’m bleeding. Did she just hit me with a shovel? I lay down on my back, stretch my legs out under Vikki’s Range Rover. I look up at the ceiling and see a naked light bulb, gleaming in the darkness. Pain shoots down the top of my head and down my spine and through my jaw. Then I get this overwhelming smell of grape jelly, for some reason.  \r\nI’m lying there on my back, and Vikki steps over me and grabs Frankie. She carries him out of the garage. I can hear her keys jangling over the sound of Frankie screaming. Then I hear her go in the house and slam the door. She’s probably gonna call the police. I just lay there, staring up at the lightbulb wondering what I ever did to deserve all this. The whole goddamn universe is out to get me. I better get outta here before the cops come. But I can’t move just yet. I stare up at the lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, and it starts to flicker.

She whispers it, like she’s afraid God might hear us. “You’re just on the pity pot,” she says. Oh fuck me. I hate when she talks like this.

She asks me how much it pays and I just shrug.\\r\\n“You know,” my mom says, “Vikki’ll be real happy you’re working again.” I start yelling that Vikki’s not taking me back and she’s probably gonna make me pay child support and then I’ll never be able to move out of here. My mom starts in again with her bullshit about counting blessings and putting something or other in my “god box,” whatever the hell that is. That’s when I say I’m going to bed.\\r\\nI lie down on the sofa in the little room where my mom’s letting me stay. It’s her sewing room. There’s a sewing machine near the closet and a tackle box full of little scissors, needles, spools of thread, and what she calls her “fat quarters” sitting on the end table. On the wall there’s a picture frame and inside it, written in baby-blue yarn, it says, “Life is hard by the yard, but by the inch it’s a cinch.”\\r\\nI’m not really tired so I just lay back and smoke a cigarette. My mom doesn’t want me smoking in her house, so I crack the window, and flick my ashes in a coke can I keep on the floor beside the couch. I start flipping through the magazine Mr. Sickles gave me.\\r\\n“The New Patriot” it’s called.  It’s kind of like a newsletter. There’s a column entitled “The Sword and the Covenant” and articles about “prepper” culture and something called “Posse Comitatus.” I don’t read the articles though, just look at the pictures. There’s all this cool stuff, ads for “Home Defense Fundamentals,” all kinds of camping gear, and an ad for food that boasts a “25-Year Shelf Life!” The ads reminds me of when I was a kid and I’d come across those cool ads at the end of comic books for stuff like the “10-in-One Optical Device,” the “Mess Kit/Canteen Combo,” or, my favorite, the “X-Ray Vision” glasses that promised you could see through clothes or even skin. (“Amaze and embarrass everyone!” the ad said). But I never ordered any of that stuff. I’d just sit and look at the ads for the x-ray glasses or for the hypnotist lessons, daydreaming about the ads more than I read the comics. \\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI show up at the American Preparedness store a little before three on Tuesday, like Mr. Sickles told me to. I wear khakis and a button-down denim shirt I got at Target, trying to look like Mr. Sickles and Russ. Mr. Sickles wears those brown loafers with tassels on them. Girl shoes, I call them. I don’t wear those. I wear my black Reeboks like I used to wear when I worked at the airport. They look like dress shoes if you don’t look too close. Russ wears hiking boots.\\r\\nMr. Sickles has me fill out some forms, and then he has Russ show me around the shop. There’s a lot of cool stuff, like a “Pandemic Flu Kit,” a big squirt bottle of yellowish liquid labeled “Fire Suppressor,” and fully stocked backpacks, stuffed with flashlights, light sticks, a compass, a poncho, waterproof matches, and even a kids coloring book.\\r\\nThe coloring book starts me thinking about Frankie, about how much he’d enjoy the scouting equipment and camping gear. That day I talked to my brother-in-law, the day Vikki kicked me out, he said, “That boy needs you.” And I start thinking that maybe he’s right. I mean, that’s what people are always saying, aren’t they? That kids need their fathers? Especially boys. Maybe that’s just what Frankie and I need, a little father-son weekend, a camping trip. Maybe some fishing. But Vikki’ll never go for it. She can be such a bitch. I can just hear her now. “Ronnie, he’s only three years old. It’s September!” He’s my fucking kid too, though.\\r\\nAround seven o’clock I take my break. Mr. Sickles has already gone home, so it’s just me and Russ. I go out back for a smoke. Russ comes out too for a minute, and I tell him I want to get some of this cool shit that the store has.\\r\\n“Oh, Alan’s real cool about that,” he says. “He lets you take stuff on credit.”\\r\\nMan, I’d sure like to get one of those backpacks, and maybe a little stove. Maybe I could take Frankie up to Tallulah Falls. \\r\\nI get home from work about nine thirty. My mom’s still up, sitting on the couch watching “America’s Got Talent” or something.  I go into the kitchen and call Vikki.\\r\\n“Hey, Vik,” I say when she picks up. “How’s Frankie?”\\r\\nShe starts right in with the bitching about child support and then I tell her about my new job and how I want to take Frankie camping on Saturday.\\r\\nShe doesn’t say anything at all. For a second I thought maybe she hung up or we got disconnected.  Then she just says, “Ronnie,” sounding all exasperated, like she has a headache or something. Like I’m some big headache when all I wanna do is spend some time with my son. “Quality time,” they call it, right? And I’m saying this and she’s not saying anything. It’s like she runs out of things to say.  Then she says, “no.” and I ask her why and she just says “because I said so” like I’m some fucking kid.  “Well, we see about that,” I’m about to say, but she’s already hung up.\\r\\nI slam down the phone and walk out to the living room. My mom’s still sitting on the couch. She asks what’s wrong. “Nothing,” I say. “Fucking Vikki,” I say to myself. “I don’t want to talk about it.”\\r\\n“Q-tip,” she says.\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n“Q-tip. Quit. Taking. It. Personally.”\\r\\n“Oh, for fuck’s sake. I’m going to bed.”\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI pack up the Celebrity with some old camping gear. I throw in the new backpack and little stove that Mr. Sickles let me take from the store after my third week. I also pack the Lightning McQueen lantern I got for Frankie at Target and the animal crackers and juice boxes that I bought. Then I drive over to Vikki’s house.\\r\\nIt’s Friday afternoon. I’m going to pick up Frankie and bring him back to my mom’s to spend the night. That way, he can spend some time with his grandma, and then he and I can get an early start tomorrow. I’ve timed it so I’ll get to Vikki’s right around the time I know she’s getting home from work. Surprise her. I want to catch her outside. Talk to her a minute. Show her the stuff I got, how much thought I put into this trip. If I don’t get there before her and she’s already in the house, she might just pretend she’s not home or not let me in. But I’m taking him. He’s my kid too. Even my mom said that. \\r\\nI wait down the street in my car until I see her SUV pull up in the driveway. She pulls in the garage, and I get out of my car and start walking toward the house. I walk up the driveway and see Vikki. She’s lifting Frankie out of his car seat. She hears me walking up and looks up. Then she ducks her head right back into the car to grab Frankie. I can already tell she’s not happy to see me. \\r\\nShe pokes her head out of the car’s back door again as I approach. She’s still messing with the car seat. “Ronnie, what are you doing here--. No,” she says. “No Ronnie. “ I push her out of the way so I can grab Frankie from the backseat. I hear her fall backwards onto some cardboard boxes that are sitting on the floor of the garage against the wall.\\r\\n“Goddammit, Ronnie.”\\r\\n“He’s my kid too,” I scream. “Hey Frank,” I say, turning and bending down to look in the backseat. “Daddy’s gonna take you camping.  Wanna go camping with daddy?”\\r\\nHe looks happy to see me, I guess, but he looks a little scared too. He’ll calm down once we get on the road. I try lifting him out of the car seat but I guess one of his seatbelts is still buckled. I crouch down to take a closer look. Then I feel this crushing pain on the back of my head and I drop down onto the floor of the garage. Jesus Christ! What the fuck? I think I’m bleeding. Did she just hit me with a shovel? I lay down on my back, stretch my legs out under Vikki’s Range Rover. I look up at the ceiling and see a naked light bulb, gleaming in the darkness. Pain shoots down the top of my head and down my spine and through my jaw. Then I get this overwhelming smell of grape jelly, for some reason.  \r\nI’m lying there on my back, and Vikki steps over me and grabs Frankie. She carries him out of the garage. I can hear her keys jangling over the sound of Frankie screaming. Then I hear her go in the house and slam the door. She’s probably gonna call the police. I just lay there, staring up at the lightbulb wondering what I ever did to deserve all this. The whole goddamn universe is out to get me. I better get outta here before the cops come. But I can’t move just yet. I stare up at the lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, and it starts to flicker.

(484, 1, '2016-08-05 11:35:40', '2016-08-05 19:35:40', 'I must be fucking cursed. \\r\\nGod’s punishing me. He always has. That’s why things come so easy to everybody else and why I have to fight like hell to just hold on to the little I got.\\r\\n“You shouldn’t talk like that,” my mother says. She whispers it, like she’s afraid God might hear us. “You’re just on the pity pot,” she says. Oh fuck me. I hate when she talks like this. She started going to Al-anon years ago, when my dad was still alive. Now, she can hardly hold a slogan-free conversation. She sounds like she’s in a cult or some shit. “You know what you need?” she says. “A gratitude list.”\\r\\n“Mom, for chrissake.”\\r\\n“Okay, okay.  Sorry,” she whispers, tiptoeing out to the kitchen, like there’s a sleeping baby in here. Or a bomb.\\r\\nI moved back in with my mom about a couple of weeks ago after Vikki threw me out. Me and Vikki went to couples counseling. Once. One time. I couldn’t take it. I stormed out. The guy wouldn’t let me talk. He kept fuckin’ shushing me, telling me to keep my voice down. Vikki does that all the time, too. She thinks I have a hearing problem and that’s why I talk so loud. But if people would just fuckin’ listen . . .  Anyway, after Dr. Kiplinger shushed me, I said, “If we can’t talk about her meddling parents, then I’m out of here.” And I got up and left. I knew Vikki was gonna be pissed but I didn’t think she’d fucking leave me.\\r\\nThat was around ten a.m. Later, just after lunch, when I went to pick up Frankie from day care, there was Vikki, sitting in the passenger seat of her mother’s Town Car with Frankie, our three-year old, in the child’s seat in the back. I could see his little face, sucking on a sippy cup in his car seat, but I was afraid to go near the car. I didn’t want her mother ganging up on me too. I motioned for Vikki to come over.\\r\\n“Ronnie,” she said, “I’m giving you the weekend to get your stuff out of the house. I want you gone.” She didn’t even seem pissed. Just cold. And even though her mother was still sitting in the car waiting for her and couldn’t even hear what we were saying, I still felt like they were ganging up on me. They always ganged up on me. I think her mom wanted to split us up from the beginning. That’s what I wanted to talk to the couple’s counselor about.  But then it felt like he was ganging up on me, too.\\r\\nI went straight home and packed my shit. Right before I left the house, I called my brother-in-law Brian at work to tell him Vikki and I were getting a divorce. I don’t know, maybe I was hoping he and Lisa would put me up for a while. But he didn’t offer. Shit, he didn’t even sound surprised that Vikki threw me out; it sounded like he already knew all about it, like maybe Vikki’d been talking to her sister about our problems for a while. “Don’t do anything stupid,” Brian said right before I hung up. “That boy needs you.” I bet they were all in on it together, all of them, pushing Vikki to leave me.\\r\\nMy mom’s out in the kitchen now, emptying the dishwasher, it sounds like, and I can still hear her mumbling her Al-anon slogans, some horseshit about “letting go.” Then she calls into the living room to me, “Hey, Ronnie. Why don’t you go pick us up some take-out for us from Sierra’s? That’ll make you feel better.”\\r\\nI say okay and I jump in my Celebrity and drive over to Sierra’s. I place the order at the bar, think about ordering a beer, but instead walk outside to wait, maybe have a smoke. In the strip mall across the parking lot I see this store I’ve never noticed before. It’s called “American Preparedness.” There’s a huge camouflage hummer parked out in front of the shop, with American flags waving from it. I don’t know how I could’ve missed it.\\r\\nI walk over to the shop. The glass door has these red, white, and blue streamers draped over the top corners like it’s the Fourth of July. In the front window there’s flier advertising a course in “Total Home Prep--Surviving Disaster Without Leaving Home” and a sign that says “Grand Opening.” I walk in to take a look around. The lanky guy standing behind the counter nods to me.\\r\\nI stroll in to the middle of the store and say, “’American Preparedness?’ What are you guys preparing for?”\\r\\n“Any and all eventualities,” the guy behind the counter says with complete confidence, like he’s giving a speech. “Financial crises, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, Ebola outbreaks, marauders, you name it.” He walks out from behind the counter and extends his hand. “We’re just trying to keep alive all the know-how our grandparents had. You know, the common sense stuff.” He introduces himself. “Russ.”\\r\\nI shake his hand. “Nice to meet you. I’m Ronnie.” I look around. There are food rations, machines to convert urine into water, gas-powered electrical generators, safes, ammo, firearms, knives like you wouldn’t believe. My grandparents were Canadian. I don’t think they had this kind of know-how.\\r\\n“What can we interest you in today, Ronnie?”\\r\\nThen I get to thinking. I ask for a job application. I stand at the counter and fill it out as Russ and I chat. I finish filling out the application and am just getting ready to leave. Russ looks down at my application. “Ex-military?” he asks. “Hold on just a minute. Let me show your application to Alan,” he says, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb. He walks back through a black curtain behind the counter.\\r\\nI walk around the store. It’s a small shop, cramped really, and packed with stuff. In the corner by the front counter there’s a mannequin in full body armor with a sign that says, “Protecting the Protectors—Together in the Fight.” Across from that, against the wall, are some “Jet Boil Stoves,” whatever those are, and above them a glossy poster advertising “Gourmet Emergency Food” with a woman in the ad who looks just like Marie Osmond. I’m staring at it,  thinking, “It can’t be her, right?” when Russ comes back from behind the curtain with an older gentleman walking behind him. \\r\\n“Hi,” the older guy says. We shake hands. “I’m Alan Sickles. Russ here says you’re interested in coming to work for us Mr. . . . ?” He glances down at my application.\\r\\n“Erbie,” I say. “Ronnie Erbie.  Yes, sir, I am.”\\r\\n“How’d you hear about us?”\\r\\n“Well, I was just picking up some food across the way there and thought I’d take a look.”\\r\\n“Are you familiar with Survivalist culture, Mr. Erbie”?\\r\\n“No, not really. You can call me Ronnie,” I tell him.\\r\\n“Okay, Ronnie.  Well, prior knowledge isn’t essential.  Russ says you’re ex-military?” He looks down at my application again.\\r\\n“Yep. Naval Air. Four years. Active.” \\r\\n“What’d you do in the Navy, Ronnie”?\\r\\n“Power plants. I worked on airplane engines. C-2s. Prop planes. I worked down at Hartsfield, too, for a while when I got out.”\\r\\n“Okay. Well, can you start next week? Why don’t you just come in next Tuesday around three and we’ll get ya started,” Sickles says. “You can be reached at this number?”\\r\\n“Yep.”\\r\\n“Okay,” Sickles says, shaking my hand again, “we’ll see ya Tuesday then. Thanks for coming in.” He walks me toward the front of the store. “And here,” he pulls a little magazine from a display behind me as I open the door of the shop to leave. “Take this with you and have a look.”\\r\\n“Thanks,” I say, curling up the magazine and raising it in the air in a kind of salute toward Russ as I walk out.\\r\\n#\\r\\nMe and my mom eat our Sierra’s take-out in front of the TV watching “Celebrity Wife Swap.” Some woman I never heard of who used to be the kid on a sitcom back in the ‘90s is switching families with the wife of some former boy-band member. The families argue about stupid shit, like one of the families is vegetarian or healthy or something and the other one isn’t. I start thinking about Vikki, and about how much she told her family about the problems we were having. I’m pretty sure she told her parents about that time she called the cops on me.\\r\\nSitting there in front of the TV, I start thinking about back when Frankie was really little. I used to get pissed off about how much Vikki was feeding him. It seemed like she nursed him all the time. She’d sit with him up in the glider in our room for what seemed like hours. No way was the kid eating that fucking much. I started thinking that maybe she was always nursing him so she could get away from me.\\r\\nOne night, I insisted on putting Frankie to bed myself. You know, just to get it over with. But he wouldn’t take the bottle. Vikki got all up in my face, telling me to give him to her so she could nurse him. I dropped Frankie on our bed, and I grabbed Vikki by the arms and shoved her backwards out of our bedroom, pushing her down on the floor in the hallway. Then I locked the bedroom door and tried to get Frankie to go to sleep. But he just kept screaming.\\r\\nThen I heard the cops at the front door. Vikki must’ve called them. When I came downstairs holding Frankie, he was all red-faced and beaded with sweat. These two fat cops were standing in the kitchen with Vikki, and she was showing them where I grabbed her. The inside of her arms were all red and blueish, and you could see outlines of my fingers where I’d gripped her. “She bruises really easy,” I told them, but those fucking cops didn’t want to hear my side of anything. Nobody ever--\\r\\n“Ronnie,” I hear my mom say beside me. “You okay?”\\r\\n“I’m fine. Just thinking.”\\r\\nThere’s a commercial on the TV now, so I get up and take our plates out to the kitchen and dump ‘em in the sink. I come back to the couch and tell my mom about the job at American Preparedness. She asks me how much it pays and I just shrug.\\r\\n“You know,” my mom says, “Vikki’ll be real happy you’re working again.” I start yelling that Vikki’s not taking me back and she’s probably gonna make me pay child support and then I’ll never be able to move out of here.

My mom’s still sitting on the couch. She asks what’s wrong. “Nothing,” I say. “Fucking Vikki,” I say to myself. “I don’t want to talk about it.”\\r\\n“Q-tip,” she says.\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n“Q-tip. Quit. Taking. It. Personally.”\\r\\n“Oh, for fuck’s sake. I’m going to bed.”\\r\\n#\\r\\nI pack up the Celebrity with some old camping gear.

I knew Vikki was gonna be pissed but I didn’t think she’d fucking leave me.\\r\\nThat was around ten a.m. Later, just after lunch, when I went to pick up Frankie from day care, there was Vikki, sitting in the passenger seat of her mother’s Town Car with Frankie, our three-year old, in the child’s seat in the back. I could see his little face, sucking on a sippy cup in his car seat, but I was afraid to go near the car. I didn’t want her mother ganging up on me too. I motioned for Vikki to come over.\\r\\n“Ronnie,” she said, “I’m giving you the weekend to get your stuff out of the house. I want you gone.” She didn’t even seem pissed. Just cold. And even though her mother was still sitting in the car waiting for her and couldn’t even hear what we were saying, I still felt like they were ganging up on me. They always ganged up on me. I think her mom wanted to split us up from the beginning. That’s what I wanted to talk to the couple’s counselor about.  But then it felt like he was ganging up on me, too.\\r\\nI went straight home and packed my shit. Right before I left the house, I called my brother-in-law Brian at work to tell him Vikki and I were getting a divorce. I don’t know, maybe I was hoping he and Lisa would put me up for a while. But he didn’t offer. Shit, he didn’t even sound surprised that Vikki threw me out; it sounded like he already knew all about it, like maybe Vikki’d been talking to her sister about our problems for a while. “Don’t do anything stupid,” Brian said right before I hung up. “That boy needs you.” I bet they were all in on it together, all of them, pushing Vikki to leave me.\\r\\nMy mom’s out in the kitchen now, emptying the dishwasher, it sounds like, and I can still hear her mumbling her Al-anon slogans, some horseshit about “letting go.” Then she calls into the living room to me, “Hey, Ronnie. Why don’t you go pick us up some take-out for us from Sierra’s? That’ll make you feel better.”\\r\\nI say okay and I jump in my Celebrity and drive over to Sierra’s. I place the order at the bar, think about ordering a beer, but instead walk outside to wait, maybe have a smoke. In the strip mall across the parking lot I see this store I’ve never noticed before. It’s called “American Preparedness.” There’s a huge camouflage hummer parked out in front of the shop, with American flags waving from it. I don’t know how I could’ve missed it.\\r\\nI walk over to the shop. The glass door has these red, white, and blue streamers draped over the top corners like it’s the Fourth of July. In the front window there’s flier advertising a course in “Total Home Prep--Surviving Disaster Without Leaving Home” and a sign that says “Grand Opening.” I walk in to take a look around. The lanky guy standing behind the counter nods to me.\\r\\nI stroll in to the middle of the store and say, “’American Preparedness?’ What are you guys preparing for?”\\r\\n“Any and all eventualities,” the guy behind the counter says with complete confidence, like he’s giving a speech. “Financial crises, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, Ebola outbreaks, marauders, you name it.” He walks out from behind the counter and extends his hand. “We’re just trying to keep alive all the know-how our grandparents had. You know, the common sense stuff.” He introduces himself. “Russ.”\\r\\nI shake his hand. “Nice to meet you. I’m Ronnie.” I look around. There are food rations, machines to convert urine into water, gas-powered electrical generators, safes, ammo, firearms, knives like you wouldn’t believe. My grandparents were Canadian. I don’t think they had this kind of know-how.\\r\\n“What can we interest you in today, Ronnie?”\\r\\nThen I get to thinking. I ask for a job application. I stand at the counter and fill it out as Russ and I chat. I finish filling out the application and am just getting ready to leave. Russ looks down at my application. “Ex-military?” he asks. “Hold on just a minute. Let me show your application to Alan,” he says, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb. He walks back through a black curtain behind the counter.\\r\\nI walk around the store. It’s a small shop, cramped really, and packed with stuff. In the corner by the front counter there’s a mannequin in full body armor with a sign that says, “Protecting the Protectors—Together in the Fight.” Across from that, against the wall, are some “Jet Boil Stoves,” whatever those are, and above them a glossy poster advertising “Gourmet Emergency Food” with a woman in the ad who looks just like Marie Osmond. I’m staring at it,  thinking, “It can’t be her, right?” when Russ comes back from behind the curtain with an older gentleman walking behind him. \\r\\n“Hi,” the older guy says. We shake hands. “I’m Alan Sickles. Russ here says you’re interested in coming to work for us Mr. . . . ?” He glances down at my application.\\r\\n“Erbie,” I say. “Ronnie Erbie.  Yes, sir, I am.”\\r\\n“How’d you hear about us?”\\r\\n“Well, I was just picking up some food across the way there and thought I’d take a look.”\\r\\n“Are you familiar with Survivalist culture, Mr. Erbie”?\\r\\n“No, not really. You can call me Ronnie,” I tell him.\\r\\n“Okay, Ronnie.  Well, prior knowledge isn’t essential.  Russ says you’re ex-military?” He looks down at my application again.\\r\\n“Yep. Naval Air. Four years. Active.” \\r\\n“What’d you do in the Navy, Ronnie”?\\r\\n“Power plants. I worked on airplane engines. C-2s. Prop planes. I worked down at Hartsfield, too, for a while when I got out.”\\r\\n“Okay. Well, can you start next week? Why don’t you just come in next Tuesday around three and we’ll get ya started,” Sickles says. “You can be reached at this number?”\\r\\n“Yep.”\\r\\n“Okay,” Sickles says, shaking my hand again, “we’ll see ya Tuesday then. Thanks for coming in.” He walks me toward the front of the store. “And here,” he pulls a little magazine from a display behind me as I open the door of the shop to leave. “Take this with you and have a look.”\\r\\n“Thanks,” I say, curling up the magazine and raising it in the air in a kind of salute toward Russ as I walk out.\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nMe and my mom eat our Sierra’s take-out in front of the TV watching “Celebrity Wife Swap.” Some woman I never heard of who used to be the kid on a sitcom back in the ‘90s is switching families with the wife of some former boy-band member. The families argue about stupid shit, like one of the families is vegetarian or healthy or something and the other one isn’t. I start thinking about Vikki, and about how much she told her family about the problems we were having. I’m pretty sure she told her parents about that time she called the cops on me.\\r\\nSitting there in front of the TV, I start thinking about back when Frankie was really little. I used to get pissed off about how much Vikki was feeding him. It seemed like she nursed him all the time. She’d sit with him up in the glider in our room for what seemed like hours. No way was the kid eating that fucking much. I started thinking that maybe she was always nursing him so she could get away from me.\\r\\nOne night, I insisted on putting Frankie to bed myself. You know, just to get it over with. But he wouldn’t take the bottle. Vikki got all up in my face, telling me to give him to her so she could nurse him. I dropped Frankie on our bed, and I grabbed Vikki by the arms and shoved her backwards out of our bedroom, pushing her down on the floor in the hallway. Then I locked the bedroom door and tried to get Frankie to go to sleep. But he just kept screaming.\\r\\nThen I heard the cops at the front door. Vikki must’ve called them. When I came downstairs holding Frankie, he was all red-faced and beaded with sweat. These two fat cops were standing in the kitchen with Vikki, and she was showing them where I grabbed her. The inside of her arms were all red and blueish, and you could see outlines of my fingers where I’d gripped her. “She bruises really easy,” I told them, but those fucking cops didn’t want to hear my side of anything. Nobody ever--\\r\\n“Ronnie,” I hear my mom say beside me. “You okay?”\\r\\n“I’m fine. Just thinking.”\\r\\nThere’s a commercial on the TV now, so I get up and take our plates out to the kitchen and dump ‘em in the sink. I come back to the couch and tell my mom about the job at American Preparedness. She asks me how much it pays and I just shrug.\\r\\n“You know,” my mom says, “Vikki’ll be real happy you’re working again.” I start yelling that Vikki’s not taking me back and she’s probably gonna make me pay child support and then I’ll never be able to move out of here. My mom starts in again with her bullshit about counting blessings and putting something or other in my “god box,” whatever the hell that is. That’s when I say I’m going to bed.\\r\\nI lie down on the sofa in the little room where my mom’s letting me stay. It’s her sewing room. There’s a sewing machine near the closet and a tackle box full of little scissors, needles, spools of thread, and what she calls her “fat quarters” sitting on the end table. On the wall there’s a picture frame and inside it, written in baby-blue yarn, it says, “Life is hard by the yard, but by the inch it’s a cinch.”\\r\\nI’m not really tired so I just lay back and smoke a cigarette. My mom doesn’t want me smoking in her house, so I crack the window, and flick my ashes in a coke can I keep on the floor beside the couch. I start flipping through the magazine Mr. Sickles gave me.\\r\\n“The New Patriot” it’s called.  It’s kind of like a newsletter. There’s a column entitled “The Sword and the Covenant” and articles about “prepper” culture and something called “Posse Comitatus.” I don’t read the articles though, just look at the pictures. There’s all this cool stuff, ads for “Home Defense Fundamentals,” all kinds of camping gear, and an ad for food that boasts a “25-Year Shelf Life!” The ads reminds me of when I was a kid and I’d come across those cool ads at the end of comic books for stuff like the “10-in-One Optical Device,” the “Mess Kit/Canteen Combo,” or, my favorite, the “X-Ray Vision” glasses that promised you could see through clothes or even skin. (“Amaze and embarrass everyone!” the ad said). But I never ordered any of that stuff. I’d just sit and look at the ads for the x-ray glasses or for the hypnotist lessons, daydreaming about the ads more than I read the comics. \\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI show up at the American Preparedness store a little before three on Tuesday, like Mr. Sickles told me to. I wear khakis and a button-down denim shirt I got at Target, trying to look like Mr. Sickles and Russ. Mr. Sickles wears those brown loafers with tassels on them. Girl shoes, I call them. I don’t wear those. I wear my black Reeboks like I used to wear when I worked at the airport. They look like dress shoes if you don’t look too close. Russ wears hiking boots.\\r\\nMr. Sickles has me fill out some forms, and then he has Russ show me around the shop. There’s a lot of cool stuff, like a “Pandemic Flu Kit,” a big squirt bottle of yellowish liquid labeled “Fire Suppressor,” and fully stocked backpacks, stuffed with flashlights, light sticks, a compass, a poncho, waterproof matches, and even a kids coloring book.\\r\\nThe coloring book starts me thinking about Frankie, about how much he’d enjoy the scouting equipment and camping gear. That day I talked to my brother-in-law, the day Vikki kicked me out, he said, “That boy needs you.” And I start thinking that maybe he’s right. I mean, that’s what people are always saying, aren’t they? That kids need their fathers? Especially boys. Maybe that’s just what Frankie and I need, a little father-son weekend, a camping trip. Maybe some fishing. But Vikki’ll never go for it. She can be such a bitch. I can just hear her now. “Ronnie, he’s only three years old. It’s September!” He’s my fucking kid too, though.\\r\\nAround seven o’clock I take my break. Mr. Sickles has already gone home, so it’s just me and Russ. I go out back for a smoke. Russ comes out too for a minute, and I tell him I want to get some of this cool shit that the store has.\\r\\n“Oh, Alan’s real cool about that,” he says. “He lets you take stuff on credit.”\\r\\nMan, I’d sure like to get one of those backpacks, and maybe a little stove. Maybe I could take Frankie up to Tallulah Falls. \\r\\nI get home from work about nine thirty. My mom’s still up, sitting on the couch watching “America’s Got Talent” or something.  I go into the kitchen and call Vikki.\\r\\n“Hey, Vik,” I say when she picks up. “How’s Frankie?”\\r\\nShe starts right in with the bitching about child support and then I tell her about my new job and how I want to take Frankie camping on Saturday.\\r\\nShe doesn’t say anything at all. For a second I thought maybe she hung up or we got disconnected.  Then she just says, “Ronnie,” sounding all exasperated, like she has a headache or something. Like I’m some big headache when all I wanna do is spend some time with my son. “Quality time,” they call it, right? And I’m saying this and she’s not saying anything. It’s like she runs out of things to say.  Then she says, “no.” and I ask her why and she just says “because I said so” like I’m some fucking kid.  “Well, we see about that,” I’m about to say, but she’s already hung up.\\r\\nI slam down the phone and walk out to the living room. My mom’s still sitting on the couch. She asks what’s wrong. “Nothing,” I say. “Fucking Vikki,” I say to myself. “I don’t want to talk about it.”\\r\\n“Q-tip,” she says.\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n“Q-tip. Quit. Taking. It. Personally.”\\r\\n“Oh, for fuck’s sake. I’m going to bed.”\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI pack up the Celebrity with some old camping gear. I throw in the new backpack and little stove that Mr. Sickles let me take from the store after my third week. I also pack the Lightning McQueen lantern I got for Frankie at Target and the animal crackers and juice boxes that I bought. Then I drive over to Vikki’s house.\\r\\nIt’s Friday afternoon. I’m going to pick up Frankie and bring him back to my mom’s to spend the night. That way, he can spend some time with his grandma, and then he and I can get an early start tomorrow. I’ve timed it so I’ll get to Vikki’s right around the time I know she’s getting home from work. Surprise her. I want to catch her outside. Talk to her a minute. Show her the stuff I got, how much thought I put into this trip. If I don’t get there before her and she’s already in the house, she might just pretend she’s not home or not let me in. But I’m taking him. He’s my kid too. Even my mom said that. \\r\\nI wait down the street in my car until I see her SUV pull up in the driveway. She pulls in the garage, and I get out of my car and start walking toward the house. I walk up the driveway and see Vikki. She’s lifting Frankie out of his car seat. She hears me walking up and looks up. Then she ducks her head right back into the car to grab Frankie. I can already tell she’s not happy to see me. \\r\\nShe pokes her head out of the car’s back door again as I approach. She’s still messing with the car seat. “Ronnie, what are you doing here--. No,” she says. “No Ronnie. “ I push her out of the way so I can grab Frankie from the backseat. I hear her fall backwards onto some cardboard boxes that are sitting on the floor of the garage against the wall.\\r\\n“Goddammit, Ronnie.”\\r\\n“He’s my kid too,” I scream. “Hey Frank,” I say, turning and bending down to look in the backseat. “Daddy’s gonna take you camping.  Wanna go camping with daddy?”\\r\\nHe looks happy to see me, I guess, but he looks a little scared too. He’ll calm down once we get on the road. I try lifting him out of the car seat but I guess one of his seatbelts is still buckled. I crouch down to take a closer look. Then I feel this crushing pain on the back of my head and I drop down onto the floor of the garage. Jesus Christ! What the fuck? I think I’m bleeding. Did she just hit me with a shovel? I lay down on my back, stretch my legs out under Vikki’s Range Rover. I look up at the ceiling and see a naked light bulb, gleaming in the darkness. Pain shoots down the top of my head and down my spine and through my jaw. Then I get this overwhelming smell of grape jelly, for some reason.  \r\nI’m lying there on my back, and Vikki steps over me and grabs Frankie. She carries him out of the garage. I can hear her keys jangling over the sound of Frankie screaming. Then I hear her go in the house and slam the door. She’s probably gonna call the police. I just lay there, staring up at the lightbulb wondering what I ever did to deserve all this. The whole goddamn universe is out to get me. I better get outta here before the cops come. But I can’t move just yet. I stare up at the lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, and it starts to flicker.

That’s why things come so easy to everybody else and why I have to fight like hell to just hold on to the little I got.\\r\\n“You shouldn’t talk like that,” my mother says. She whispers it, like she’s afraid God might hear us. “You’re just on the pity pot,” she says. Oh fuck me.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI hate when she talks like this. She started going to Al-anon years ago, when my dad was still alive. Now, she can hardly hold a slogan-free conversation. She sounds like she’s in a cult or some shit. “You know what you need?” she says. “A gratitude list.”\\r\\n“Mom, for chrissake.”\\r\\n“Okay, okay.  Sorry,” she whispers, tiptoeing out to the kitchen, like there’s a sleeping baby in here. Or a bomb.\\r\\nI moved back in with my mom about a couple of weeks ago after Vikki threw me out. Me and Vikki went to couples counseling. Once. One time. I couldn’t take it. I stormed out. The guy wouldn’t let me talk. He kept fuckin’ shushing me, telling me to keep my voice down. Vikki does that all the time, too. She thinks I have a hearing problem and that’s why I talk so loud. But if people would just fuckin’ listen . . .  Anyway, after Dr. Kiplinger shushed me, I said, “If we can’t talk about her meddling parents, then I’m out of here.” And I got up and left. I knew Vikki was gonna be pissed but I didn’t think she’d fucking leave me.\\r\\nThat was around ten a.m. Later, just after lunch, when I went to pick up Frankie from day care, there was Vikki, sitting in the passenger seat of her mother’s Town Car with Frankie, our three-year old, in the child’s seat in the back. I could see his little face, sucking on a sippy cup in his car seat, but I was afraid to go near the car. I didn’t want her mother ganging up on me too. I motioned for Vikki to come over.\\r\\n“Ronnie,” she said, “I’m giving you the weekend to get your stuff out of the house. I want you gone.” She didn’t even seem pissed. Just cold. And even though her mother was still sitting in the car waiting for her and couldn’t even hear what we were saying, I still felt like they were ganging up on me. They always ganged up on me. I think her mom wanted to split us up from the beginning. That’s what I wanted to talk to the couple’s counselor about.  But then it felt like he was ganging up on me, too.\\r\\nI went straight home and packed my shit. Right before I left the house, I called my brother-in-law Brian at work to tell him Vikki and I were getting a divorce. I don’t know, maybe I was hoping he and Lisa would put me up for a while. But he didn’t offer. Shit, he didn’t even sound surprised that Vikki threw me out; it sounded like he already knew all about it, like maybe Vikki’d been talking to her sister about our problems for a while. “Don’t do anything stupid,” Brian said right before I hung up. “That boy needs you.” I bet they were all in on it together, all of them, pushing Vikki to leave me.\\r\\nMy mom’s out in the kitchen now, emptying the dishwasher, it sounds like, and I can still hear her mumbling her Al-anon slogans, some horseshit about “letting go.” Then she calls into the living room to me, “Hey, Ronnie. Why don’t you go pick us up some take-out for us from Sierra’s? That’ll make you feel better.”\\r\\nI say okay and I jump in my Celebrity and drive over to Sierra’s. I place the order at the bar, think about ordering a beer, but instead walk outside to wait, maybe have a smoke. In the strip mall across the parking lot I see this store I’ve never noticed before. It’s called “American Preparedness.” There’s a huge camouflage hummer parked out in front of the shop, with American flags waving from it. I don’t know how I could’ve missed it.\\r\\nI walk over to the shop. The glass door has these red, white, and blue streamers draped over the top corners like it’s the Fourth of July. In the front window there’s flier advertising a course in “Total Home Prep--Surviving Disaster Without Leaving Home” and a sign that says “Grand Opening.” I walk in to take a look around. The lanky guy standing behind the counter nods to me.\\r\\nI stroll in to the middle of the store and say, “’American Preparedness?’ What are you guys preparing for?”\\r\\n“Any and all eventualities,” the guy behind the counter says with complete confidence, like he’s giving a speech. “Financial crises, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, Ebola outbreaks, marauders, you name it.” He walks out from behind the counter and extends his hand. “We’re just trying to keep alive all the know-how our grandparents had. You know, the common sense stuff.” He introduces himself. “Russ.”\\r\\nI shake his hand. “Nice to meet you. I’m Ronnie.” I look around. There are food rations, machines to convert urine into water, gas-powered electrical generators, safes, ammo, firearms, knives like you wouldn’t believe. My grandparents were Canadian. I don’t think they had this kind of know-how.\\r\\n“What can we interest you in today, Ronnie?”\\r\\nThen I get to thinking. I ask for a job application. I stand at the counter and fill it out as Russ and I chat. I finish filling out the application and am just getting ready to leave. Russ looks down at my application. “Ex-military?” he asks. “Hold on just a minute. Let me show your application to Alan,” he says, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb. He walks back through a black curtain behind the counter.\\r\\nI walk around the store. It’s a small shop, cramped really, and packed with stuff. In the corner by the front counter there’s a mannequin in full body armor with a sign that says, “Protecting the Protectors—Together in the Fight.” Across from that, against the wall, are some “Jet Boil Stoves,” whatever those are, and above them a glossy poster advertising “Gourmet Emergency Food” with a woman in the ad who looks just like Marie Osmond. I’m staring at it,  thinking, “It can’t be her, right?” when Russ comes back from behind the curtain with an older gentleman walking behind him. \\r\\n“Hi,” the older guy says. We shake hands. “I’m Alan Sickles. Russ here says you’re interested in coming to work for us Mr. . . . ?” He glances down at my application.\\r\\n“Erbie,” I say. “Ronnie Erbie.  Yes, sir, I am.”\\r\\n“How’d you hear about us?”\\r\\n“Well, I was just picking up some food across the way there and thought I’d take a look.”\\r\\n“Are you familiar with Survivalist culture, Mr. Erbie”?\\r\\n“No, not really. You can call me Ronnie,” I tell him.\\r\\n“Okay, Ronnie.  Well, prior knowledge isn’t essential.  Russ says you’re ex-military?” He looks down at my application again.\\r\\n“Yep. Naval Air. Four years. Active.” \\r\\n“What’d you do in the Navy, Ronnie”?\\r\\n“Power plants. I worked on airplane engines. C-2s. Prop planes. I worked down at Hartsfield, too, for a while when I got out.”\\r\\n“Okay. Well, can you start next week? Why don’t you just come in next Tuesday around three and we’ll get ya started,” Sickles says. “You can be reached at this number?”\\r\\n“Yep.”\\r\\n“Okay,” Sickles says, shaking my hand again, “we’ll see ya Tuesday then. Thanks for coming in.” He walks me toward the front of the store. “And here,” he pulls a little magazine from a display behind me as I open the door of the shop to leave. “Take this with you and have a look.”\\r\\n“Thanks,” I say, curling up the magazine and raising it in the air in a kind of salute toward Russ as I walk out.\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nMe and my mom eat our Sierra’s take-out in front of the TV watching “Celebrity Wife Swap.” Some woman I never heard of who used to be the kid on a sitcom back in the ‘90s is switching families with the wife of some former boy-band member. The families argue about stupid shit, like one of the families is vegetarian or healthy or something and the other one isn’t. I start thinking about Vikki, and about how much she told her family about the problems we were having. I’m pretty sure she told her parents about that time she called the cops on me.\\r\\nSitting there in front of the TV, I start thinking about back when Frankie was really little. I used to get pissed off about how much Vikki was feeding him. It seemed like she nursed him all the time. She’d sit with him up in the glider in our room for what seemed like hours. No way was the kid eating that fucking much. I started thinking that maybe she was always nursing him so she could get away from me.\\r\\nOne night, I insisted on putting Frankie to bed myself. You know, just to get it over with. But he wouldn’t take the bottle. Vikki got all up in my face, telling me to give him to her so she could nurse him. I dropped Frankie on our bed, and I grabbed Vikki by the arms and shoved her backwards out of our bedroom, pushing her down on the floor in the hallway. Then I locked the bedroom door and tried to get Frankie to go to sleep. But he just kept screaming.\\r\\nThen I heard the cops at the front door. Vikki must’ve called them. When I came downstairs holding Frankie, he was all red-faced and beaded with sweat. These two fat cops were standing in the kitchen with Vikki, and she was showing them where I grabbed her. The inside of her arms were all red and blueish, and you could see outlines of my fingers where I’d gripped her. “She bruises really easy,” I told them, but those fucking cops didn’t want to hear my side of anything. Nobody ever--\\r\\n“Ronnie,” I hear my mom say beside me. “You okay?”\\r\\n“I’m fine. Just thinking.”\\r\\nThere’s a commercial on the TV now, so I get up and take our plates out to the kitchen and dump ‘em in the sink. I come back to the couch and tell my mom about the job at American Preparedness. She asks me how much it pays and I just shrug.\\r\\n“You know,” my mom says, “Vikki’ll be real happy you’re working again.” I start yelling that Vikki’s not taking me back and she’s probably gonna make me pay child support and then I’ll never be able to move out of here. My mom starts in again with her bullshit about counting blessings and putting something or other in my “god box,” whatever the hell that is. That’s when I say I’m going to bed.\\r\\nI lie down on the sofa in the little room where my mom’s letting me stay. It’s her sewing room. There’s a sewing machine near the closet and a tackle box full of little scissors, needles, spools of thread, and what she calls her “fat quarters” sitting on the end table. On the wall there’s a picture frame and inside it, written in baby-blue yarn, it says, “Life is hard by the yard, but by the inch it’s a cinch.”\\r\\nI’m not really tired so I just lay back and smoke a cigarette. My mom doesn’t want me smoking in her house, so I crack the window, and flick my ashes in a coke can I keep on the floor beside the couch. I start flipping through the magazine Mr. Sickles gave me.\\r\\n“The New Patriot” it’s called.  It’s kind of like a newsletter. There’s a column entitled “The Sword and the Covenant” and articles about “prepper” culture and something called “Posse Comitatus.” I don’t read the articles though, just look at the pictures. There’s all this cool stuff, ads for “Home Defense Fundamentals,” all kinds of camping gear, and an ad for food that boasts a “25-Year Shelf Life!” The ads reminds me of when I was a kid and I’d come across those cool ads at the end of comic books for stuff like the “10-in-One Optical Device,” the “Mess Kit/Canteen Combo,” or, my favorite, the “X-Ray Vision” glasses that promised you could see through clothes or even skin. (“Amaze and embarrass everyone!” the ad said). But I never ordered any of that stuff. I’d just sit and look at the ads for the x-ray glasses or for the hypnotist lessons, daydreaming about the ads more than I read the comics. \\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI show up at the American Preparedness store a little before three on Tuesday, like Mr. Sickles told me to. I wear khakis and a button-down denim shirt I got at Target, trying to look like Mr. Sickles and Russ. Mr. Sickles wears those brown loafers with tassels on them. Girl shoes, I call them. I don’t wear those. I wear my black Reeboks like I used to wear when I worked at the airport. They look like dress shoes if you don’t look too close. Russ wears hiking boots.\\r\\nMr. Sickles has me fill out some forms, and then he has Russ show me around the shop. There’s a lot of cool stuff, like a “Pandemic Flu Kit,” a big squirt bottle of yellowish liquid labeled “Fire Suppressor,” and fully stocked backpacks, stuffed with flashlights, light sticks, a compass, a poncho, waterproof matches, and even a kids coloring book.\\r\\nThe coloring book starts me thinking about Frankie, about how much he’d enjoy the scouting equipment and camping gear. That day I talked to my brother-in-law, the day Vikki kicked me out, he said, “That boy needs you.” And I start thinking that maybe he’s right. I mean, that’s what people are always saying, aren’t they? That kids need their fathers? Especially boys. Maybe that’s just what Frankie and I need, a little father-son weekend, a camping trip. Maybe some fishing. But Vikki’ll never go for it. She can be such a bitch. I can just hear her now. “Ronnie, he’s only three years old. It’s September!” He’s my fucking kid too, though.\\r\\nAround seven o’clock I take my break. Mr. Sickles has already gone home, so it’s just me and Russ. I go out back for a smoke. Russ comes out too for a minute, and I tell him I want to get some of this cool shit that the store has.\\r\\n“Oh, Alan’s real cool about that,” he says. “He lets you take stuff on credit.”\\r\\nMan, I’d sure like to get one of those backpacks, and maybe a little stove. Maybe I could take Frankie up to Tallulah Falls. \\r\\nI get home from work about nine thirty. My mom’s still up, sitting on the couch watching “America’s Got Talent” or something.  I go into the kitchen and call Vikki.\\r\\n“Hey, Vik,” I say when she picks up. “How’s Frankie?”\\r\\nShe starts right in with the bitching about child support and then I tell her about my new job and how I want to take Frankie camping on Saturday.\\r\\nShe doesn’t say anything at all. For a second I thought maybe she hung up or we got disconnected.  Then she just says, “Ronnie,” sounding all exasperated, like she has a headache or something. Like I’m some big headache when all I wanna do is spend some time with my son. “Quality time,” they call it, right? And I’m saying this and she’s not saying anything. It’s like she runs out of things to say.  Then she says, “no.” and I ask her why and she just says “because I said so” like I’m some fucking kid.  “Well, we see about that,” I’m about to say, but she’s already hung up.\\r\\nI slam down the phone and walk out to the living room. My mom’s still sitting on the couch. She asks what’s wrong. “Nothing,” I say. “Fucking Vikki,” I say to myself. “I don’t want to talk about it.”\\r\\n“Q-tip,” she says.\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n“Q-tip. Quit. Taking. It. Personally.”\\r\\n“Oh, for fuck’s sake. I’m going to bed.”\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI pack up the Celebrity with some old camping gear. I throw in the new backpack and little stove that Mr. Sickles let me take from the store after my third week. I also pack the Lightning McQueen lantern I got for Frankie at Target and the animal crackers and juice boxes that I bought. Then I drive over to Vikki’s house.\\r\\nIt’s Friday afternoon. I’m going to pick up Frankie and bring him back to my mom’s to spend the night. That way, he can spend some time with his grandma, and then he and I can get an early start tomorrow. I’ve timed it so I’ll get to Vikki’s right around the time I know she’s getting home from work. Surprise her. I want to catch her outside. Talk to her a minute. Show her the stuff I got, how much thought I put into this trip. If I don’t get there before her and she’s already in the house, she might just pretend she’s not home or not let me in. But I’m taking him. He’s my kid too. Even my mom said that. \\r\\nI wait down the street in my car until I see her SUV pull up in the driveway. She pulls in the garage, and I get out of my car and start walking toward the house. I walk up the driveway and see Vikki. She’s lifting Frankie out of his car seat. She hears me walking up and looks up. Then she ducks her head right back into the car to grab Frankie. I can already tell she’s not happy to see me. \\r\\nShe pokes her head out of the car’s back door again as I approach. She’s still messing with the car seat. “Ronnie, what are you doing here--. No,” she says. “No Ronnie. “ I push her out of the way so I can grab Frankie from the backseat. I hear her fall backwards onto some cardboard boxes that are sitting on the floor of the garage against the wall.\\r\\n“Goddammit, Ronnie.”\\r\\n“He’s my kid too,” I scream. “Hey Frank,” I say, turning and bending down to look in the backseat. “Daddy’s gonna take you camping.  Wanna go camping with daddy?”\\r\\nHe looks happy to see me, I guess, but he looks a little scared too. He’ll calm down once we get on the road. I try lifting him out of the car seat but I guess one of his seatbelts is still buckled. I crouch down to take a closer look. Then I feel this crushing pain on the back of my head and I drop down onto the floor of the garage. Jesus Christ! What the fuck? I think I’m bleeding. Did she just hit me with a shovel? I lay down on my back, stretch my legs out under Vikki’s Range Rover. I look up at the ceiling and see a naked light bulb, gleaming in the darkness. Pain shoots down the top of my head and down my spine and through my jaw. Then I get this overwhelming smell of grape jelly, for some reason.  \r\nI’m lying there on my back, and Vikki steps over me and grabs Frankie. She carries him out of the garage. I can hear her keys jangling over the sound of Frankie screaming. Then I hear her go in the house and slam the door. She’s probably gonna call the police. I just lay there, staring up at the lightbulb wondering what I ever did to deserve all this. The whole goddamn universe is out to get me. I better get outta here before the cops come. But I can’t move just yet. I stare up at the lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, and it starts to flicker.

I knew Vikki was gonna be pissed but I didn’t think she’d fucking leave me.\\r\\nThat was around ten a.m. Later, just after lunch, when I went to pick up Frankie from day care, there was Vikki, sitting in the passenger seat of her mother’s Town Car with Frankie, our three-year old, in the child’s seat in the back. I could see his little face, sucking on a sippy cup in his car seat, but I was afraid to go near the car. I didn’t want her mother ganging up on me too. I motioned for Vikki to come over.\\r\\n“Ronnie,” she said, “I’m giving you the weekend to get your stuff out of the house. I want you gone.” She didn’t even seem pissed. Just cold. And even though her mother was still sitting in the car waiting for her and couldn’t even hear what we were saying, I still felt like they were ganging up on me. They always ganged up on me. I think her mom wanted to split us up from the beginning. That’s what I wanted to talk to the couple’s counselor about.  But then it felt like he was ganging up on me, too.\\r\\nI went straight home and packed my shit. Right before I left the house, I called my brother-in-law Brian at work to tell him Vikki and I were getting a divorce. I don’t know, maybe I was hoping he and Lisa would put me up for a while. But he didn’t offer. Shit, he didn’t even sound surprised that Vikki threw me out; it sounded like he already knew all about it, like maybe Vikki’d been talking to her sister about our problems for a while. “Don’t do anything stupid,” Brian said right before I hung up. “That boy needs you.” I bet they were all in on it together, all of them, pushing Vikki to leave me.\\r\\nMy mom’s out in the kitchen now, emptying the dishwasher, it sounds like, and I can still hear her mumbling her Al-anon slogans, some horseshit about “letting go.” Then she calls into the living room to me, “Hey, Ronnie. Why don’t you go pick us up some take-out for us from Sierra’s? That’ll make you feel better.”\\r\\nI say okay and I jump in my Celebrity and drive over to Sierra’s. I place the order at the bar, think about ordering a beer, but instead walk outside to wait, maybe have a smoke. In the strip mall across the parking lot I see this store I’ve never noticed before. It’s called “American Preparedness.” There’s a huge camouflage hummer parked out in front of the shop, with American flags waving from it. I don’t know how I could’ve missed it.\\r\\nI walk over to the shop. The glass door has these red, white, and blue streamers draped over the top corners like it’s the Fourth of July. In the front window there’s flier advertising a course in “Total Home Prep--Surviving Disaster Without Leaving Home” and a sign that says “Grand Opening.” I walk in to take a look around. The lanky guy standing behind the counter nods to me.\\r\\nI stroll in to the middle of the store and say, “’American Preparedness?’ What are you guys preparing for?”\\r\\n“Any and all eventualities,” the guy behind the counter says with complete confidence, like he’s giving a speech. “Financial crises, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, Ebola outbreaks, marauders, you name it.” He walks out from behind the counter and extends his hand. “We’re just trying to keep alive all the know-how our grandparents had. You know, the common sense stuff.” He introduces himself. “Russ.”\\r\\nI shake his hand. “Nice to meet you. I’m Ronnie.” I look around. There are food rations, machines to convert urine into water, gas-powered electrical generators, safes, ammo, firearms, knives like you wouldn’t believe. My grandparents were Canadian. I don’t think they had this kind of know-how.\\r\\n“What can we interest you in today, Ronnie?”\\r\\nThen I get to thinking. I ask for a job application. I stand at the counter and fill it out as Russ and I chat. I finish filling out the application and am just getting ready to leave. Russ looks down at my application. “Ex-military?” he asks. “Hold on just a minute. Let me show your application to Alan,” he says, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb. He walks back through a black curtain behind the counter.\\r\\nI walk around the store. It’s a small shop, cramped really, and packed with stuff. In the corner by the front counter there’s a mannequin in full body armor with a sign that says, “Protecting the Protectors—Together in the Fight.” Across from that, against the wall, are some “Jet Boil Stoves,” whatever those are, and above them a glossy poster advertising “Gourmet Emergency Food” with a woman in the ad who looks just like Marie Osmond. I’m staring at it,  thinking, “It can’t be her, right?” when Russ comes back from behind the curtain with an older gentleman walking behind him. \\r\\n“Hi,” the older guy says. We shake hands. “I’m Alan Sickles. Russ here says you’re interested in coming to work for us Mr. . . . ?” He glances down at my application.\\r\\n“Erbie,” I say. “Ronnie Erbie.  Yes, sir, I am.”\\r\\n“How’d you hear about us?”\\r\\n“Well, I was just picking up some food across the way there and thought I’d take a look.”\\r\\n“Are you familiar with Survivalist culture, Mr. Erbie”?\\r\\n“No, not really. You can call me Ronnie,” I tell him.\\r\\n“Okay, Ronnie.  Well, prior knowledge isn’t essential.  Russ says you’re ex-military?” He looks down at my application again.\\r\\n“Yep. Naval Air. Four years. Active.” \\r\\n“What’d you do in the Navy, Ronnie”?\\r\\n“Power plants. I worked on airplane engines. C-2s. Prop planes. I worked down at Hartsfield, too, for a while when I got out.”\\r\\n“Okay. Well, can you start next week? Why don’t you just come in next Tuesday around three and we’ll get ya started,” Sickles says. “You can be reached at this number?”\\r\\n“Yep.”\\r\\n“Okay,” Sickles says, shaking my hand again, “we’ll see ya Tuesday then. Thanks for coming in.” He walks me toward the front of the store. “And here,” he pulls a little magazine from a display behind me as I open the door of the shop to leave. “Take this with you and have a look.”\\r\\n“Thanks,” I say, curling up the magazine and raising it in the air in a kind of salute toward Russ as I walk out.\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nMe and my mom eat our Sierra’s take-out in front of the TV watching “Celebrity Wife Swap.” Some woman I never heard of who used to be the kid on a sitcom back in the ‘90s is switching families with the wife of some former boy-band member. The families argue about stupid shit, like one of the families is vegetarian or healthy or something and the other one isn’t. I start thinking about Vikki, and about how much she told her family about the problems we were having. I’m pretty sure she told her parents about that time she called the cops on me.\\r\\nSitting there in front of the TV, I start thinking about back when Frankie was really little. I used to get pissed off about how much Vikki was feeding him. It seemed like she nursed him all the time. She’d sit with him up in the glider in our room for what seemed like hours. No way was the kid eating that fucking much. I started thinking that maybe she was always nursing him so she could get away from me.\\r\\nOne night, I insisted on putting Frankie to bed myself. You know, just to get it over with. But he wouldn’t take the bottle. Vikki got all up in my face, telling me to give him to her so she could nurse him. I dropped Frankie on our bed, and I grabbed Vikki by the arms and shoved her backwards out of our bedroom, pushing her down on the floor in the hallway. Then I locked the bedroom door and tried to get Frankie to go to sleep. But he just kept screaming.\\r\\nThen I heard the cops at the front door. Vikki must’ve called them. When I came downstairs holding Frankie, he was all red-faced and beaded with sweat. These two fat cops were standing in the kitchen with Vikki, and she was showing them where I grabbed her. The inside of her arms were all red and blueish, and you could see outlines of my fingers where I’d gripped her. “She bruises really easy,” I told them, but those fucking cops didn’t want to hear my side of anything. Nobody ever--\\r\\n“Ronnie,” I hear my mom say beside me. “You okay?”\\r\\n“I’m fine. Just thinking.”\\r\\nThere’s a commercial on the TV now, so I get up and take our plates out to the kitchen and dump ‘em in the sink. I come back to the couch and tell my mom about the job at American Preparedness. She asks me how much it pays and I just shrug.\\r\\n“You know,” my mom says, “Vikki’ll be real happy you’re working again.” I start yelling that Vikki’s not taking me back and she’s probably gonna make me pay child support and then I’ll never be able to move out of here. My mom starts in again with her bullshit about counting blessings and putting something or other in my “god box,” whatever the hell that is. That’s when I say I’m going to bed.\\r\\nI lie down on the sofa in the little room where my mom’s letting me stay. It’s her sewing room. There’s a sewing machine near the closet and a tackle box full of little scissors, needles, spools of thread, and what she calls her “fat quarters” sitting on the end table. On the wall there’s a picture frame and inside it, written in baby-blue yarn, it says, “Life is hard by the yard, but by the inch it’s a cinch.”\\r\\nI’m not really tired so I just lay back and smoke a cigarette. My mom doesn’t want me smoking in her house, so I crack the window, and flick my ashes in a coke can I keep on the floor beside the couch. I start flipping through the magazine Mr. Sickles gave me.\\r\\n“The New Patriot” it’s called.  It’s kind of like a newsletter. There’s a column entitled “The Sword and the Covenant” and articles about “prepper” culture and something called “Posse Comitatus.” I don’t read the articles though, just look at the pictures. There’s all this cool stuff, ads for “Home Defense Fundamentals,” all kinds of camping gear, and an ad for food that boasts a “25-Year Shelf Life!” The ads reminds me of when I was a kid and I’d come across those cool ads at the end of comic books for stuff like the “10-in-One Optical Device,” the “Mess Kit/Canteen Combo,” or, my favorite, the “X-Ray Vision” glasses that promised you could see through clothes or even skin. (“Amaze and embarrass everyone!” the ad said). But I never ordered any of that stuff. I’d just sit and look at the ads for the x-ray glasses or for the hypnotist lessons, daydreaming about the ads more than I read the comics. \\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI show up at the American Preparedness store a little before three on Tuesday, like Mr. Sickles told me to. I wear khakis and a button-down denim shirt I got at Target, trying to look like Mr. Sickles and Russ. Mr. Sickles wears those brown loafers with tassels on them. Girl shoes, I call them. I don’t wear those. I wear my black Reeboks like I used to wear when I worked at the airport. They look like dress shoes if you don’t look too close. Russ wears hiking boots.\\r\\nMr. Sickles has me fill out some forms, and then he has Russ show me around the shop. There’s a lot of cool stuff, like a “Pandemic Flu Kit,” a big squirt bottle of yellowish liquid labeled “Fire Suppressor,” and fully stocked backpacks, stuffed with flashlights, light sticks, a compass, a poncho, waterproof matches, and even a kids coloring book.\\r\\nThe coloring book starts me thinking about Frankie, about how much he’d enjoy the scouting equipment and camping gear. That day I talked to my brother-in-law, the day Vikki kicked me out, he said, “That boy needs you.” And I start thinking that maybe he’s right. I mean, that’s what people are always saying, aren’t they? That kids need their fathers? Especially boys. Maybe that’s just what Frankie and I need, a little father-son weekend, a camping trip. Maybe some fishing. But Vikki’ll never go for it. She can be such a bitch. I can just hear her now. “Ronnie, he’s only three years old. It’s September!” He’s my fucking kid too, though.\\r\\nAround seven o’clock I take my break. Mr. Sickles has already gone home, so it’s just me and Russ. I go out back for a smoke. Russ comes out too for a minute, and I tell him I want to get some of this cool shit that the store has.\\r\\n“Oh, Alan’s real cool about that,” he says. “He lets you take stuff on credit.”\\r\\nMan, I’d sure like to get one of those backpacks, and maybe a little stove. Maybe I could take Frankie up to Tallulah Falls. \\r\\nI get home from work about nine thirty. My mom’s still up, sitting on the couch watching “America’s Got Talent” or something.  I go into the kitchen and call Vikki.\\r\\n“Hey, Vik,” I say when she picks up. “How’s Frankie?”\\r\\nShe starts right in with the bitching about child support and then I tell her about my new job and how I want to take Frankie camping on Saturday.\\r\\nShe doesn’t say anything at all. For a second I thought maybe she hung up or we got disconnected.  Then she just says, “Ronnie,” sounding all exasperated, like she has a headache or something. Like I’m some big headache when all I wanna do is spend some time with my son. “Quality time,” they call it, right? And I’m saying this and she’s not saying anything. It’s like she runs out of things to say.  Then she says, “no.” and I ask her why and she just says “because I said so” like I’m some fucking kid.  “Well, we see about that,” I’m about to say, but she’s already hung up.\\r\\nI slam down the phone and walk out to the living room. My mom’s still sitting on the couch. She asks what’s wrong. “Nothing,” I say. “Fucking Vikki,” I say to myself. “I don’t want to talk about it.”\\r\\n“Q-tip,” she says.\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n“Q-tip. Quit. Taking. It. Personally.”\\r\\n“Oh, for fuck’s sake. I’m going to bed.”\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI pack up the Celebrity with some old camping gear. I throw in the new backpack and little stove that Mr. Sickles let me take from the store after my third week. I also pack the Lightning McQueen lantern I got for Frankie at Target and the animal crackers and juice boxes that I bought. Then I drive over to Vikki’s house.\\r\\nIt’s Friday afternoon. I’m going to pick up Frankie and bring him back to my mom’s to spend the night. That way, he can spend some time with his grandma, and then he and I can get an early start tomorrow. I’ve timed it so I’ll get to Vikki’s right around the time I know she’s getting home from work. Surprise her. I want to catch her outside. Talk to her a minute. Show her the stuff I got, how much thought I put into this trip. If I don’t get there before her and she’s already in the house, she might just pretend she’s not home or not let me in. But I’m taking him. He’s my kid too. Even my mom said that. \\r\\nI wait down the street in my car until I see her SUV pull up in the driveway. She pulls in the garage, and I get out of my car and start walking toward the house. I walk up the driveway and see Vikki. She’s lifting Frankie out of his car seat. She hears me walking up and looks up. Then she ducks her head right back into the car to grab Frankie. I can already tell she’s not happy to see me. \\r\\nShe pokes her head out of the car’s back door again as I approach. She’s still messing with the car seat. “Ronnie, what are you doing here--. No,” she says. “No Ronnie. “ I push her out of the way so I can grab Frankie from the backseat. I hear her fall backwards onto some cardboard boxes that are sitting on the floor of the garage against the wall.\\r\\n“Goddammit, Ronnie.”\\r\\n“He’s my kid too,” I scream. “Hey Frank,” I say, turning and bending down to look in the backseat. “Daddy’s gonna take you camping.  Wanna go camping with daddy?”\\r\\nHe looks happy to see me, I guess, but he looks a little scared too. He’ll calm down once we get on the road. I try lifting him out of the car seat but I guess one of his seatbelts is still buckled. I crouch down to take a closer look. Then I feel this crushing pain on the back of my head and I drop down onto the floor of the garage. Jesus Christ! What the fuck? I think I’m bleeding. Did she just hit me with a shovel? I lay down on my back, stretch my legs out under Vikki’s Range Rover. I look up at the ceiling and see a naked light bulb, gleaming in the darkness. Pain shoots down the top of my head and down my spine and through my jaw. Then I get this overwhelming smell of grape jelly, for some reason.  \r\nI’m lying there on my back, and Vikki steps over me and grabs Frankie. She carries him out of the garage. I can hear her keys jangling over the sound of Frankie screaming. Then I hear her go in the house and slam the door. She’s probably gonna call the police. I just lay there, staring up at the lightbulb wondering what I ever did to deserve all this. The whole goddamn universe is out to get me. I better get outta here before the cops come. But I can’t move just yet. I stare up at the lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, and it starts to flicker.

That’s why things come so easy to everybody else and why I have to fight like hell to just hold on to the little I got.\\r\\n“You shouldn’t talk like that,” my mother says. She whispers it, like she’s afraid God might hear us. “You’re just on the pity pot,” she says. Oh fuck me. I hate when she talks like this. She started going to Al-anon years ago, when my dad was still alive. Now, she can hardly hold a slogan-free conversation. She sounds like she’s in a cult or some shit. “You know what you need?” she says. “A gratitude list.”\r\n<!--more-->\r\n“Mom, for chrissake.”\\r\\n“Okay, okay.  Sorry,” she whispers, tiptoeing out to the kitchen, like there’s a sleeping baby in here. Or a bomb.\\r\\nI moved back in with my mom about a couple of weeks ago after Vikki threw me out. Me and Vikki went to couples counseling. Once. One time. I couldn’t take it. I stormed out. The guy wouldn’t let me talk. He kept fuckin’ shushing me, telling me to keep my voice down. Vikki does that all the time, too. She thinks I have a hearing problem and that’s why I talk so loud. But if people would just fuckin’ listen . . .  Anyway, after Dr. Kiplinger shushed me, I said, “If we can’t talk about her meddling parents, then I’m out of here.” And I got up and left. I knew Vikki was gonna be pissed but I didn’t think she’d fucking leave me.\\r\\nThat was around ten a.m. Later, just after lunch, when I went to pick up Frankie from day care, there was Vikki, sitting in the passenger seat of her mother’s Town Car with Frankie, our three-year old, in the child’s seat in the back. I could see his little face, sucking on a sippy cup in his car seat, but I was afraid to go near the car. I didn’t want her mother ganging up on me too. I motioned for Vikki to come over.\\r\\n“Ronnie,” she said, “I’m giving you the weekend to get your stuff out of the house. I want you gone.” She didn’t even seem pissed. Just cold. And even though her mother was still sitting in the car waiting for her and couldn’t even hear what we were saying, I still felt like they were ganging up on me. They always ganged up on me. I think her mom wanted to split us up from the beginning. That’s what I wanted to talk to the couple’s counselor about.  But then it felt like he was ganging up on me, too.\\r\\nI went straight home and packed my shit. Right before I left the house, I called my brother-in-law Brian at work to tell him Vikki and I were getting a divorce. I don’t know, maybe I was hoping he and Lisa would put me up for a while. But he didn’t offer. Shit, he didn’t even sound surprised that Vikki threw me out; it sounded like he already knew all about it, like maybe Vikki’d been talking to her sister about our problems for a while. “Don’t do anything stupid,” Brian said right before I hung up. “That boy needs you.” I bet they were all in on it together, all of them, pushing Vikki to leave me.\\r\\nMy mom’s out in the kitchen now, emptying the dishwasher, it sounds like, and I can still hear her mumbling her Al-anon slogans, some horseshit about “letting go.” Then she calls into the living room to me, “Hey, Ronnie. Why don’t you go pick us up some take-out for us from Sierra’s? That’ll make you feel better.”\\r\\nI say okay and I jump in my Celebrity and drive over to Sierra’s. I place the order at the bar, think about ordering a beer, but instead walk outside to wait, maybe have a smoke. In the strip mall across the parking lot I see this store I’ve never noticed before. It’s called “American Preparedness.” There’s a huge camouflage hummer parked out in front of the shop, with American flags waving from it. I don’t know how I could’ve missed it.\\r\\nI walk over to the shop. The glass door has these red, white, and blue streamers draped over the top corners like it’s the Fourth of July. In the front window there’s flier advertising a course in “Total Home Prep--Surviving Disaster Without Leaving Home” and a sign that says “Grand Opening.” I walk in to take a look around. The lanky guy standing behind the counter nods to me.\\r\\nI stroll in to the middle of the store and say, “’American Preparedness?’ What are you guys preparing for?”\\r\\n“Any and all eventualities,” the guy behind the counter says with complete confidence, like he’s giving a speech. “Financial crises, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, Ebola outbreaks, marauders, you name it.” He walks out from behind the counter and extends his hand. “We’re just trying to keep alive all the know-how our grandparents had. You know, the common sense stuff.” He introduces himself. “Russ.”\\r\\nI shake his hand. “Nice to meet you. I’m Ronnie.” I look around. There are food rations, machines to convert urine into water, gas-powered electrical generators, safes, ammo, firearms, knives like you wouldn’t believe. My grandparents were Canadian. I don’t think they had this kind of know-how.\\r\\n“What can we interest you in today, Ronnie?”\\r\\nThen I get to thinking. I ask for a job application. I stand at the counter and fill it out as Russ and I chat. I finish filling out the application and am just getting ready to leave. Russ looks down at my application. “Ex-military?” he asks. “Hold on just a minute. Let me show your application to Alan,” he says, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb. He walks back through a black curtain behind the counter.\\r\\nI walk around the store. It’s a small shop, cramped really, and packed with stuff. In the corner by the front counter there’s a mannequin in full body armor with a sign that says, “Protecting the Protectors—Together in the Fight.” Across from that, against the wall, are some “Jet Boil Stoves,” whatever those are, and above them a glossy poster advertising “Gourmet Emergency Food” with a woman in the ad who looks just like Marie Osmond. I’m staring at it,  thinking, “It can’t be her, right?” when Russ comes back from behind the curtain with an older gentleman walking behind him. \\r\\n“Hi,” the older guy says. We shake hands. “I’m Alan Sickles. Russ here says you’re interested in coming to work for us Mr. . . . ?” He glances down at my application.\\r\\n“Erbie,” I say. “Ronnie Erbie.  Yes, sir, I am.”\\r\\n“How’d you hear about us?”\\r\\n“Well, I was just picking up some food across the way there and thought I’d take a look.”\\r\\n“Are you familiar with Survivalist culture, Mr. Erbie”?\\r\\n“No, not really. You can call me Ronnie,” I tell him.\\r\\n“Okay, Ronnie.  Well, prior knowledge isn’t essential.  Russ says you’re ex-military?” He looks down at my application again.\\r\\n“Yep. Naval Air. Four years. Active.” \\r\\n“What’d you do in the Navy, Ronnie”?\\r\\n“Power plants. I worked on airplane engines. C-2s. Prop planes. I worked down at Hartsfield, too, for a while when I got out.”\\r\\n“Okay. Well, can you start next week? Why don’t you just come in next Tuesday around three and we’ll get ya started,” Sickles says. “You can be reached at this number?”\\r\\n“Yep.”\\r\\n“Okay,” Sickles says, shaking my hand again, “we’ll see ya Tuesday then. Thanks for coming in.” He walks me toward the front of the store. “And here,” he pulls a little magazine from a display behind me as I open the door of the shop to leave. “Take this with you and have a look.”\\r\\n“Thanks,” I say, curling up the magazine and raising it in the air in a kind of salute toward Russ as I walk out.\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nMe and my mom eat our Sierra’s take-out in front of the TV watching “Celebrity Wife Swap.” Some woman I never heard of who used to be the kid on a sitcom back in the ‘90s is switching families with the wife of some former boy-band member. The families argue about stupid shit, like one of the families is vegetarian or healthy or something and the other one isn’t. I start thinking about Vikki, and about how much she told her family about the problems we were having. I’m pretty sure she told her parents about that time she called the cops on me.\\r\\nSitting there in front of the TV, I start thinking about back when Frankie was really little. I used to get pissed off about how much Vikki was feeding him. It seemed like she nursed him all the time. She’d sit with him up in the glider in our room for what seemed like hours. No way was the kid eating that fucking much. I started thinking that maybe she was always nursing him so she could get away from me.\\r\\nOne night, I insisted on putting Frankie to bed myself. You know, just to get it over with. But he wouldn’t take the bottle. Vikki got all up in my face, telling me to give him to her so she could nurse him. I dropped Frankie on our bed, and I grabbed Vikki by the arms and shoved her backwards out of our bedroom, pushing her down on the floor in the hallway. Then I locked the bedroom door and tried to get Frankie to go to sleep. But he just kept screaming.\\r\\nThen I heard the cops at the front door. Vikki must’ve called them. When I came downstairs holding Frankie, he was all red-faced and beaded with sweat. These two fat cops were standing in the kitchen with Vikki, and she was showing them where I grabbed her. The inside of her arms were all red and blueish, and you could see outlines of my fingers where I’d gripped her. “She bruises really easy,” I told them, but those fucking cops didn’t want to hear my side of anything. Nobody ever--\\r\\n“Ronnie,” I hear my mom say beside me. “You okay?”\\r\\n“I’m fine. Just thinking.”\\r\\nThere’s a commercial on the TV now, so I get up and take our plates out to the kitchen and dump ‘em in the sink. I come back to the couch and tell my mom about the job at American Preparedness. She asks me how much it pays and I just shrug.\\r\\n“You know,” my mom says, “Vikki’ll be real happy you’re working again.” I start yelling that Vikki’s not taking me back and she’s probably gonna make me pay child support and then I’ll never be able to move out of here. My mom starts in again with her bullshit about counting blessings and putting something or other in my “god box,” whatever the hell that is. That’s when I say I’m going to bed.\\r\\nI lie down on the sofa in the little room where my mom’s letting me stay. It’s her sewing room. There’s a sewing machine near the closet and a tackle box full of little scissors, needles, spools of thread, and what she calls her “fat quarters” sitting on the end table. On the wall there’s a picture frame and inside it, written in baby-blue yarn, it says, “Life is hard by the yard, but by the inch it’s a cinch.”\\r\\nI’m not really tired so I just lay back and smoke a cigarette. My mom doesn’t want me smoking in her house, so I crack the window, and flick my ashes in a coke can I keep on the floor beside the couch. I start flipping through the magazine Mr. Sickles gave me.\\r\\n“The New Patriot” it’s called.  It’s kind of like a newsletter. There’s a column entitled “The Sword and the Covenant” and articles about “prepper” culture and something called “Posse Comitatus.” I don’t read the articles though, just look at the pictures. There’s all this cool stuff, ads for “Home Defense Fundamentals,” all kinds of camping gear, and an ad for food that boasts a “25-Year Shelf Life!” The ads reminds me of when I was a kid and I’d come across those cool ads at the end of comic books for stuff like the “10-in-One Optical Device,” the “Mess Kit/Canteen Combo,” or, my favorite, the “X-Ray Vision” glasses that promised you could see through clothes or even skin. (“Amaze and embarrass everyone!” the ad said). But I never ordered any of that stuff. I’d just sit and look at the ads for the x-ray glasses or for the hypnotist lessons, daydreaming about the ads more than I read the comics. \\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI show up at the American Preparedness store a little before three on Tuesday, like Mr. Sickles told me to. I wear khakis and a button-down denim shirt I got at Target, trying to look like Mr. Sickles and Russ. Mr. Sickles wears those brown loafers with tassels on them. Girl shoes, I call them. I don’t wear those. I wear my black Reeboks like I used to wear when I worked at the airport. They look like dress shoes if you don’t look too close. Russ wears hiking boots.\\r\\nMr. Sickles has me fill out some forms, and then he has Russ show me around the shop. There’s a lot of cool stuff, like a “Pandemic Flu Kit,” a big squirt bottle of yellowish liquid labeled “Fire Suppressor,” and fully stocked backpacks, stuffed with flashlights, light sticks, a compass, a poncho, waterproof matches, and even a kids coloring book.\\r\\nThe coloring book starts me thinking about Frankie, about how much he’d enjoy the scouting equipment and camping gear. That day I talked to my brother-in-law, the day Vikki kicked me out, he said, “That boy needs you.” And I start thinking that maybe he’s right. I mean, that’s what people are always saying, aren’t they? That kids need their fathers? Especially boys. Maybe that’s just what Frankie and I need, a little father-son weekend, a camping trip. Maybe some fishing. But Vikki’ll never go for it. She can be such a bitch. I can just hear her now. “Ronnie, he’s only three years old. It’s September!” He’s my fucking kid too, though.\\r\\nAround seven o’clock I take my break. Mr. Sickles has already gone home, so it’s just me and Russ. I go out back for a smoke. Russ comes out too for a minute, and I tell him I want to get some of this cool shit that the store has.\\r\\n“Oh, Alan’s real cool about that,” he says. “He lets you take stuff on credit.”\\r\\nMan, I’d sure like to get one of those backpacks, and maybe a little stove. Maybe I could take Frankie up to Tallulah Falls. \\r\\nI get home from work about nine thirty. My mom’s still up, sitting on the couch watching “America’s Got Talent” or something.  I go into the kitchen and call Vikki.\\r\\n“Hey, Vik,” I say when she picks up. “How’s Frankie?”\\r\\nShe starts right in with the bitching about child support and then I tell her about my new job and how I want to take Frankie camping on Saturday.\\r\\nShe doesn’t say anything at all. For a second I thought maybe she hung up or we got disconnected.  Then she just says, “Ronnie,” sounding all exasperated, like she has a headache or something. Like I’m some big headache when all I wanna do is spend some time with my son. “Quality time,” they call it, right? And I’m saying this and she’s not saying anything. It’s like she runs out of things to say.  Then she says, “no.” and I ask her why and she just says “because I said so” like I’m some fucking kid.  “Well, we see about that,” I’m about to say, but she’s already hung up.\\r\\nI slam down the phone and walk out to the living room. My mom’s still sitting on the couch. She asks what’s wrong. “Nothing,” I say. “Fucking Vikki,” I say to myself. “I don’t want to talk about it.”\\r\\n“Q-tip,” she says.\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n“Q-tip. Quit. Taking. It. Personally.”\\r\\n“Oh, for fuck’s sake. I’m going to bed.”\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nI pack up the Celebrity with some old camping gear. I throw in the new backpack and little stove that Mr. Sickles let me take from the store after my third week. I also pack the Lightning McQueen lantern I got for Frankie at Target and the animal crackers and juice boxes that I bought. Then I drive over to Vikki’s house.\\r\\nIt’s Friday afternoon. I’m going to pick up Frankie and bring him back to my mom’s to spend the night. That way, he can spend some time with his grandma, and then he and I can get an early start tomorrow. I’ve timed it so I’ll get to Vikki’s right around the time I know she’s getting home from work. Surprise her. I want to catch her outside. Talk to her a minute. Show her the stuff I got, how much thought I put into this trip. If I don’t get there before her and she’s already in the house, she might just pretend she’s not home or not let me in. But I’m taking him. He’s my kid too. Even my mom said that. \\r\\nI wait down the street in my car until I see her SUV pull up in the driveway. She pulls in the garage, and I get out of my car and start walking toward the house. I walk up the driveway and see Vikki. She’s lifting Frankie out of his car seat. She hears me walking up and looks up. Then she ducks her head right back into the car to grab Frankie. I can already tell she’s not happy to see me. \\r\\nShe pokes her head out of the car’s back door again as I approach. She’s still messing with the car seat. “Ronnie, what are you doing here--. No,” she says. “No Ronnie. “ I push her out of the way so I can grab Frankie from the backseat. I hear her fall backwards onto some cardboard boxes that are sitting on the floor of the garage against the wall.\\r\\n“Goddammit, Ronnie.”\\r\\n“He’s my kid too,” I scream. “Hey Frank,” I say, turning and bending down to look in the backseat. “Daddy’s gonna take you camping.  Wanna go camping with daddy?”\\r\\nHe looks happy to see me, I guess, but he looks a little scared too. He’ll calm down once we get on the road. I try lifting him out of the car seat but I guess one of his seatbelts is still buckled. I crouch down to take a closer look. Then I feel this crushing pain on the back of my head and I drop down onto the floor of the garage. Jesus Christ! What the fuck? I think I’m bleeding. Did she just hit me with a shovel? I lay down on my back, stretch my legs out under Vikki’s Range Rover. I look up at the ceiling and see a naked light bulb, gleaming in the darkness. Pain shoots down the top of my head and down my spine and through my jaw. Then I get this overwhelming smell of grape jelly, for some reason.  \r\nI’m lying there on my back, and Vikki steps over me and grabs Frankie. She carries him out of the garage. I can hear her keys jangling over the sound of Frankie screaming. Then I hear her go in the house and slam the door. She’s probably gonna call the police. I just lay there, staring up at the lightbulb wondering what I ever did to deserve all this. The whole goddamn universe is out to get me. I better get outta here before the cops come. But I can’t move just yet. I stare up at the lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, and it starts to flicker.

That’s why things come so easy to everybody else and why I have to fight like hell to just hold on to the little I got.\\r\\n“You shouldn’t talk like that,” my mother says. She whispers it, like she’s afraid God might hear us. “You’re just on the pity pot,” she says. Oh fuck me. I hate when she talks like this. She started going to Al-anon years ago, when my dad was still alive. Now, she can hardly hold a slogan-free conversation.\r\n<!--more-->She sounds like she’s in a cult or some shit. “You know what you need?” she says. “A gratitude list.”\\r\\n“Mom, for chrissake.”\\r\\n“Okay, okay.  Sorry,” she whispers, tiptoeing out to the kitchen, like there’s a sleeping baby in here. Or a bomb.\\r\\nI moved back in with my mom about a couple of weeks ago after Vikki threw me out. Me and Vikki went to couples counseling. Once. One time. I couldn’t take it. I stormed out. The guy wouldn’t let me talk. He kept fuckin’ shushing me, telling me to keep my voice down. Vikki does that all the time, too. She thinks I have a hearing problem and that’s why I talk so loud. But if people would just fuckin’ listen . . .  Anyway, after Dr. Kiplinger shushed me, I said, “If we can’t talk about her meddling parents, then I’m out of here.” And I got up and left. I knew Vikki was gonna be pissed but I didn’t think she’d fucking leave me.\\r\\nThat was around ten a.m. Later, just after lunch, when I went to pick up Frankie from day care, there was Vikki, sitting in the passenger seat of her mother’s Town Car with Frankie, our three-year old, in the child’s seat in the back. I could see his little face, sucking on a sippy cup in his car seat, but I was afraid to go near the car. I didn’t want her mother ganging up on me too. I motioned for Vikki to come over.\\r\\n“Ronnie,” she said, “I’m giving you the weekend to get your stuff out of the house. I want you gone.” She didn’t even seem pissed. Just cold. And even though her mother was still sitting in the car waiting for her and couldn’t even hear what we were saying, I still felt like they were ganging up on me. They always ganged up on me. I think her mom wanted to split us up from the beginning. That’s what I wanted to talk to the couple’s counselor about.  But then it felt like he was ganging up on me, too.\\r\\nI went straight home and packed my shit. Right before I left the house, I called my brother-in-law Brian at work to tell him Vikki and I were getting a divorce. I don’t know, maybe I was hoping he and Lisa would put me up for a while. But he didn’t offer. Shit, he didn’t even sound surprised that Vikki threw me out; it sounded like he already knew all about it, like maybe Vikki’d been talking to her sister about our problems for a while. “Don’t do anything stupid,” Brian said right before I hung up. “That boy needs you.” I bet they were all in on it together, all of them, pushing Vikki to leave me.\\r\\nMy mom’s out in the kitchen now, emptying the dishwasher, it sounds like, and I can still hear her mumbling her Al-anon slogans, some horseshit about “letting go.” Then she calls into the living room to me, “Hey, Ronnie. Why don’t you go pick us up some take-out for us from Sierra’s? That’ll make you feel better.”\\r\\nI say okay and I jump in my Celebrity and drive over to Sierra’s. I place the order at the bar, think about ordering a beer, but instead walk outside to wait, maybe have a smoke. In the strip mall across the parking lot I see this store I’ve never noticed before. It’s called “American Preparedness.” There’s a huge camouflage hummer parked out in front of the shop, with American flags waving from it. I don’t know how I could’ve missed it.\\r\\nI walk over to the shop. The glass door has these red, white, and blue streamers draped over the top corners like it’s the Fourth of July. In the front window there’s flier advertising a course in “Total Home Prep--Surviving Disaster Without Leaving Home” and a sign that says “Grand Opening.” I walk in to take a look around. The lanky guy standing behind the counter nods to me.\\r\\nI stroll in to the middle of the store and say, “’American Preparedness?’ What are you guys preparing for?”\\r\\n“Any and all eventualities,” the guy behind the counter says with complete confidence, like he’s giving a speech. “Financial crises, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, Ebola outbreaks, marauders, you name it.” He walks out from behind the counter and extends his hand. “We’re just trying to keep alive all the know-how our grandparents had. You know, the common sense stuff.” He introduces himself. “Russ.”\\r\\nI shake his hand. “Nice to meet you. I’m Ronnie.” I look around. There are food rations, machines to convert urine into water, gas-powered electrical generators, safes, ammo, firearms, knives like you wouldn’t believe. My grandparents were Canadian. I don’t think they had this kind of know-how.\\r\\n“What can we interest you in today, Ronnie?”\\r\\nThen I get to thinking. I ask for a job application. I stand at the counter and fill it out as Russ and I chat. I finish filling out the application and am just getting ready to leave. Russ looks down at my application. “Ex-military?” he asks. “Hold on just a minute. Let me show your application to Alan,” he says, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb. He walks back through a black curtain behind the counter.\\r\\nI walk around the store. It’s a small shop, cramped really, and packed with stuff. In the corner by the front counter there’s a mannequin in full body armor with a sign that says, “Protecting the Protectors—Together in the Fight.” Across from that, against the wall, are some “Jet Boil Stoves,” whatever those are, and above them a glossy poster advertising “Gourmet Emergency Food” with a woman in the ad who looks just like Marie Osmond. I’m staring at it,  thinking, “It can’t be her, right?” when Russ comes back from behind the curtain with an older gentleman walking behind him. \\r\\n“Hi,” the older guy says. We shake hands. “I’m Alan Sickles. Russ here says you’re interested in coming to work for us Mr. . . . ?” He glances down at my application.\\r\\n“Erbie,” I say. “Ronnie Erbie.  Yes, sir, I am.”\\r\\n“How’d you hear about us?”\\r\\n“Well, I was just picking up some food across the way there and thought I’d take a look.”\\r\\n“Are you familiar with Survivalist culture, Mr. Erbie”?\\r\\n“No, not really.

I worked down at Hartsfield, too, for a while when I got out.”\\r\\n“Okay. Well, can you start next week? Why don’t you just come in next Tuesday around three and we’ll get ya started,” Sickles says. “You can be reached at this number?”\\r\\n“Yep.”\\r\\n“Okay,” Sickles says, shaking my hand again, “we’ll see ya Tuesday then. Thanks for coming in.” He walks me toward the front of the store. “And here,” he pulls a little magazine from a display behind me as I open the door of the shop to leave. “Take this with you and have a look.”\\r\\n“Thanks,” I say, curling up the magazine and raising it in the air in a kind of salute toward Russ as I walk out.\\r\\n<span class=\"separator\">#</span>\\r\\nMe and my mom eat our Sierra’s take-out in front of the TV watching “Celebrity Wife Swap.” Some woman I never heard of who used to be the kid on a sitcom back in the ‘90s is switching families with the wife of some former boy-band member.

I try lifting him out of the car seat but I guess one of his seatbelts is still buckled. I crouch down to take a closer look. Then I feel this crushing pain on the back of my head and I drop down onto the floor of the garage. Jesus Christ! What the fuck? I think I’m bleeding. Did she just hit me with a shovel? I lay down on my back, stretch my legs out under Vikki’s Range Rover. I look up at the ceiling and see a naked light bulb, gleaming in the darkness. Pain shoots down the top of my head and down my spine and through my jaw. Then I get this overwhelming smell of grape jelly, for some reason.  \r\nI’m lying there on my back, and Vikki steps over me and grabs Frankie. She carries him out of the garage. I can hear her keys jangling over the sound of Frankie screaming. Then I hear her go in the house and slam the door. She’s probably gonna call the police. I just lay there, staring up at the lightbulb wondering what I ever did to deserve all this. The whole goddamn universe is out to get me. I better get outta here before the cops come. But I can’t move just yet. I stare up at the lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, and it starts to flicker.

(482, 1, '2016-08-05 10:47:07', '2016-08-05 18:47:07', 'The reason my father’s eyebrows were singed that morning, he told me, was because he and a friend had rescued a man from a burning building the night before. He’d said it so calmly it took me a moment to hear it. He’d saved a man’s life.\r\nWhat did this mean for me?\\r\\nSuddenly, my empty breakfast bowl became filled with wonder. The day unravelled before me like a sacred scroll. All who saw me would become blinded by my second-hand glory. I wondered if the lucky ones might even touch the hem of my hand-me-down garment and be healed…\r\n<!--more-->\r\nMy father had saved a man’s life.\\r\\nSunlight crowned his head with gold as Dad recounted the night’s events in measured tones: The man had been drinking. He had fallen asleep with a lit cigarette. He had kept trying to go back inside to find his dog… There must have been firetrucks. And ambulances. Sirens, probably. I couldn’t believe I slept through it all; couldn’t believe they let me sleep through it!\\r\\nI couldn’t believe my dad had done that. And he was still eating Weeties like he always did, just with shorter eyebrows.\\r\\nToday, on the way home from work, unit number 31 was on fire. There was nobody inside, so I knocked on the door of the man at number 32. Sitting on the footpath as the firetrucks arrived, he told me he had been partway through The Lion King when I saved his life. I was pretty sure the setting sun was crowning my head with gold, but I don’t think he noticed.\\r\\nIt was Jack’s family who lived in the rental across from the units. They’d had trouble from day one, both inside and outside the house. His stepdad threw Jack’s mum around a lot and kept her on the usual leash. When Jack visited our house one Christmas afternoon, his head was bleeding from being thrown up against the aquarium by that man. His mother had gone without food to pay for presents. So we invited Jack to mow our lawns. I’d suggested ten dollars payment, but he’d shook his head. Too much. He insisted on being paid five dollars front and back, since he was convinced we needed the money. Ten years old, he used to ride past our house once a week to check if the lawns needed mowing. He was always happy to get the mower out of the shed, start it up himself and get into it…\\r\\nAt school, he would shout at teachers, and storm down the corridors with a furrowed brow. He used to punch and head-butt walls. And go for long, long walks, far from where his name was being muttered by the grown-ups in the staff room. At our house, he’d put the mower away, take his shoes off at the back door and come in for a cordial. Never asked for money, either. He’d just raise his eyebrows at me and smile.\\r\\nJack was guileless. Once, a friend and I took him and one of his friends out for a day trip. Two men and two young fellas in a car for a day – it was a riot. The boys reminded me of puppies, yapping and playing constantly until one would nip the other and then there would be a fight. A minute later, they would be playing again.\\r\\nWe’d been driving for half an hour when, out of the blue, Jack says “One time when I was praying I asked what I would do when I growed up and I heard singing.”\\r\\nIn the front seats, my friend and I looked at each other with wide, curious eyes.\\r\\nStraight away, Jack’s mate says “That would have been God and all of his little helpers.”\\r\\n“Mmm,” says Jack carelessly. “Let’s play Eye Spy.”\\r\\nJack said he spied something starting with R. It took us two country towns and a hell of a lot of highway to work out the worst speller in 4/5 Edwards was spying the windshield. We laughed all the way through Longford.\\r\\nSo, the reason my father’s eyebrows were singed way back then was because he had rescued a man from a burning building the night before. The reason my car stinks like smoke today is because I’d parked it in front of a fiery housing commission unit last Monday, only to be parked in by two firetrucks as the building’s black breath billowed for hours.\\r\\nI’m standing on the footpath, same spot I sat one week ago, right out front of where Jack used to live. The descendant of some troglodyte is directing the reins of a petrol-powered brachiosaurus, removing the last few gigantic charred timber ribs from the body of just another roasted leviathan. The job done, he switches the engine off and leans back into his seat. The beast clunks obediently into stillness, jaws tilted skyward.\\r\\nHe has seen me but does not acknowledge me. I don’t really want to talk anyway. I’m just looking at the black dirt square where someone’s home used to be. It seems so small…\\r\\n“Housing won’t rebuild it,” he shrugs, chin pointing at the empty space. “Not for another five years. Policy.”\\r\\nI say nothing, my eyes surveying the location where something became nothing.\\r\\n“It’s policy not to rebuild for five years,” he reiterates. “Otherwise they just burn ‘em all like dominoes.”\\r\\nI cross the road in silence, eyes fixed on the almost imperceptible pea-green specks throughout the sable earth. Just above my line of sight, he is clambering out of the machine.\\r\\n“Yeah, nah,” he continues, black boots thudding like Clydesdale hooves into the muck. “Won’t rebuild it.”\\r\\nWe are now standing a couple of meters apart, staring at that space where red bricks became blackened and then became someone’s first job on a Monday, at the chocolatey loam where a concrete slab used to be, and at the tiny emerald blades pushing peacefully towards the blue.\\r\\nThen I hear my voice.\\r\\n“I had no idea grass could grow so quickly.”', 'Like Fire On a House by Daniel Townsend', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', '409-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-08-05 10:47:07', '2016-08-05 18:47:07', '', 409, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/409-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The dented front door gapes open drunkenly from one rusty hinge, but I cannot see into the gloomy interior. A cracked and faded plastic swimming pool holds a few inches of scummy water and a pile of dented silver beer cans glimmering like diamonds in the blinding sunlight.\\r\\nTangled, mildewed heaps of clothing spill from a pile of rotting garbage bags.  A giant teddy bear of the type won at the fair for the ring toss sprawls on its back, sun bleached and eyeless.\\r\\n A tiny, molding woman’s shoe curls like a grub in the mud.

The heat sears my lungs and I can feel sweat plastering the hair to my head and dripping from my face. The drone of mosquitoes fills my ears, and the clothes are stuck to my body. The ground is muddy from the afternoon downpour and threatens to suck the sneakers off my feet. A crude fire pit ringed by broken cinder blocks contains the half charred remains of a dining room chair, blackened legs jutting into the sky.\\r\\nAn emaciated woman materializes in the doorway of the trailer, flicking a lit cigarette butt out into the garbage strewn lot.  It has been a long time, but I am close enough to see the sores on her face and the dead brown eyes. After blinking in the sunlight, she notices me in the yard and her face twists into an ugly rictus of a smile. Her eyes are as hard and flat as pennies.\\r\\n“What do you want?” she snarls.\\r\\nTears fill my eyes, and hot stones of sorrow fill my throat. I want to tell her to come home, but I fear she is already home.  I picture her huddling in this sweltering condemned trailer with no electric or plumbing, sucking on that foil boat. I tell myself I don’t want to know how she pays for her habit, but I’ve seen her loitering by the entrance of the trailer park and I know she takes men inside to the rat infested couch to fuck.\\r\\n For a just a fleeting instant I have a scent memory of lavender and baby powder.

(496, 1, '2011-04-12 10:00:39', '2011-04-12 18:00:39', 'They found the baby in the alleyway, next to the back door of Charlie''s. Everyone knows that the only time that door''s opened is when there''s a raid, or a fight, or both. So when the nurse - oh God, she had such tired eyes - so when she spoke on the TV, and said that it was just luck that there''d been anyone there, without even knowing about any of the fights, I told Charlie that it was better to think of the whole situation as fate, not luck.\\r\\nHe just turned around, glanced at the dusty TV above the cash register, squinted a little, and told me that he didn''t consider them things, and never did. He said that whether it was fate, or luck, that he''d ended up running this shit-hole of a bar, he didn''t care. He was just there and had to deal with it.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\"Well, that''s fate,\" I said. \"Fate''s when things happen for a reason, despite what you do, despite what choices you make.\"\\r\\n\"Trust me, Father\" he said. \"If I''d made any choices in life, it wouldn''t have been standing here with you on a hot Wednesday afternoon, heaving around jugs of beer and a broom. Instead, I''d be... well, let''s just say I wouldn''t be here.\\r\\n\"And if I was you, I''d be careful who I started talking about fate with. Aren''t you all supposed to put it down to what the big fella wants? Or are you one of those young modern priests who doesn''t actually believe in God?\"\\r\\nHe said \"modern\" as if it was a swearword. I''m sure that if it weren''t his bar he would have spat on the floor as he said it. But instead he looked back from the TV to the bar floor and carried on sweeping.\\r\\nI suppose it could have been a miracle that the girl had been found. The only reason anyone had been in the alley was because a main had burst, forcing showers of water out onto the street in front of the bar. A crew had gone back behind Charlie''s with a backhoe to dig up the street, and they''d been down there about half-an-hour when a valve went, forcing them to shut the digger off. And that was when the foreman heard the gurglings of the baby.\\r\\nNow, don''t get me wrong, I''m certain in my faith. Well. I think I am. But I just can''t believe in a God who would put an innocent thing like that in such danger in the first place, at least for no reason. I''ve got to ask more of my God than that. My God is good.\\r\\nHe''s treated me well. There aren''t many other priests my age with a parish this size. Sure, I have a few problems here and there, but really, I''ve got nothing to complain about. Well, I didn''t until today. And now look at me.\\r\\nSo I sat at the bar and watched the TV flicker from the nurse to the water company foreman, a small dark-skinned man wearing a helmet a couple of sizes too big. They''d filmed him in the alley, and he was pointing from the big trench he''d dug, then over to Charlie''s back door. The camera followed his finger, as if a hole in the ground and a dirty door could explain the absurdity of a six-week old girl being left in an alleyway behind a dive bar.\\r\\nThen the story was done, and the anchor started talking about something else.\\r\\nI tilted my glass back, felt the foamy dregs hit the top of my lips, then placed the glass back on the bar, fitting the circle of the glass exactly within the edges of the round paper coaster. I like to do that. It reassures me when everything fits. And it''s important to me that people have their idiosyncrasies; probably why I felt so comfortable with Charlie, even if most the time he''s moaning about the bar. You know, he never says goodbye. Ever. He once told me, on one of the occasions when we managed to have a real conversation, that he hates to think of never seeing people again. He can''t bear that final goodbye, the thought that that moment could be the last time he ever saw someone. If he doesn''t acknowledge their exit, then to him they never really left. Which is a little bit weird, but it makes me like him. I don''t know why.\\r\\nAnd as I left, Charlie was rubbing his broom across the dirty floor in the far corner, trying his best to ignore me.\\r\\nWhich doesn''t really go to explain what I''m doing, six hours later, telling you about Sheila. But I have to start somewhere.\\r\\nAfter Charlie''s I went about my usual Wednesday, checking on Mrs. Hemingway at the corner, making sure that the dealers lurching around in front of the boarded-up store window weren''t giving her any trouble. They weren''t, for a change, even though a couple glared at me as I walked in. They don''t like me, and I don''t blame them. Not sure I liked them too much either. I certainly don''t now. I don''t think they see me as the priest. I mean, I''m not your typical small town Father am I? I''m not much older than they are. They''re used to a little old man they can pretend to respect. Someone they can say good morning to while they''re selling vials to kids. And that''s what they had until I got here. Well, that''s not me.\\r\\nWhen I asked Mrs. Hemingway, she said she was okay like she always did, even though the stress of owning the store could be seen running rivulets of worry across her face, carving deeper lines every time I saw her. She gave me a box of Tic-Tacs, the green ones that I liked to carry in the breast pocket of my coat, and asked God to bless me. Then I ducked out the door and crossed the street to the diner.\\r\\nAt that time of day, hours from lunch but not close enough to dinner, there''s never any problem getting my spot, the booth right in the middle of the restaurant directly overlooking Mrs. Hemingway''s store. As I tidied up my knife and fork, placing them equidistantly on the place mat, parallel to the table edge with my water glass directly above the knife, I looked over at the group across the street. They looked back. We played this game. I''d stare at them, and they''d stare at me. Nothing usually happened. Just games.\\r\\nSheila was serving coffee to Riley at the counter. I heard they had a thing once, but now their conversation was strained. She was scared of him. Most people in town are. They say he''s the reason the kids are there outside the store everyday, that they work for him. But it''s only talk, so he still gets away with acting like a normal citizen, still comes in for coffee everyday, usually at the same time as me. We barely say more than a \"hey\" to each other. He''s a big man, big both ways, with dirty hairy knuckles that swallow his coffee cup, and curly sideburns that never quite become a full beard. I can''t imagine the badness he''d done to Sheila. I think she''d been resigned to it.\\r\\nShe turned to grab the water jug, and walked from behind the counter to my booth. She has a gentle walk, a smooth way of putting one foot in front of the other that leaves her long face traveling along a single line in space. Makes me think of what she could have been if she''d had her chance, if men like Riley hadn''t taken her choices from her.\\r\\nAnd that was when the madness really started. With that walk. With me and Sheila. With me not thinking.\\r\\nShe started to pour the water, leaning over my table. \"Hear about that baby they found, Father?\" she asked, not quite managing a smile. Her eyes looked tired.\\r\\n\"Yes, I did Sheila. Nasty business.\" I looked at her face, lingered on her warm brown breasts that nestled in the open neck of her shirt, then down to my glass. I knew she knew I looked. I think she felt sorry for me, couldn''t understand why a good looking man like myself would have ever wanted to choose to renounce sex. So I think she allowed me a quick peek for the same reasons I take disabled kids to theme parks, to give them a snatch of something different, to make them feel as if they were living a normal life. And she''s right, of course.\\r\\n\"And how are you? He''s not bothering you is he?\" I nodded upwards at Riley.\\r\\n\"Him? God no.\" she glanced back at the counter and lowered her voice. \"But there is something I need to talk to you about. I was waiting for you to come in.\"\\r\\n\"What is it? Sit down, tell me,\" I said, pointing to the space opposite.\\r\\n\"I can''t now. It''s something I can''t tell you here. Give me ten minutes and I''ll meet you at my car out front. It''s the red Camaro,\" she said.\\r\\nThen she walked her walk back to Riley, who was looking agitatedly at his empty cup.\\r\\nSheila had often asked me advice before, and I was pleased to give it. Youngish, good-looking women don''t often sit for any length of time with priests, I''m sure you know that, and I was glad of the company. And, I have to admit, I looked forward to spending time with her. Even with her problems, she''s good company. And she''s very easy on the eye. It''s got to the point where I see her just about everyday; usually when I drop into the diner in the afternoon just before her shift ends or we sometimes run into each other at Charlie''s.\\r\\nWe typically talk about some man or another, or her landlord, or an argument with her sister. Sometimes I think she exaggerates her problems just so she can talk to me, because they''re often easily solved. I just sit with her a while, give her options and lead her to pick the right one. Or sometimes we just talk. But this was different. We usually speak in public where anyone can hear us. There isn''t anything odd in a priest giving a parishioner advice, even if I do look at her a little too closely.\\r\\nI took a sip of ice water, placed the glass square on the coaster and stood up.\\r\\n\"Not eatin'' today Father?\" Riley''s snippy voice cut across the diner. He must have known there was something up. I never come in then leave.\\r\\n\"No. No, not. Um, feeling too well.\" I was always bad at lying.\\r\\n\"Well you better run off home then, Father.\"\\r\\n\"Yes. I think I will.\"\\r\\n\"See ya then.\"\\r\\n\"Yeah, I''ll see you later.\" He was only trying to make it worse for me. I wondered if he was the problem Sheila wanted to talk to me about. I hoped not.\\r\\nSheila''s car was parked over to the right of the lot, an old red Camaro, like she said, with dents and rust and dirty smears over its windscreen. The sort of car you''d expect a waitress to drive. I leant on the passenger side door while I waited, eyeing the dealers across the road. They were there again and again, day after day, the same five kids just standing, looking angry, swapping stares with me. They knew we were playing a game as much as I did, but they enjoyed it a lot more. I thought about what was going through their minds, if they ever got bored, if they felt it was worth it, if they were ever scared, like I was.\\r\\nShe came out of the diner almost running, defiling the gracefulness of her walk with an awkward shuffle, and motioned with her head to the car.\\r\\n\"Get in. It''s open.\"\\r\\nI pulled open the door and slid inside.\\r\\nShe drove us out, past the strip mall, past the last gas station for forty miles, out into the plain where the road disappears in the haze, then turned and parked behind a billboard for a new housing development. It was getting hotter, one of those strange days when the heat suddenly kicks up a notch around four, and I could feel moisture begin to drip from my forehead. But I think I would have been sweating anyway.\\r\\nThe silence was wrong. There are usually other people around us when we meet, and to be alone together was disjointed, uncomfortable. I wanted to tell her that she was in a safe place, that I''d protect her whatever her problem, but I couldn''t. I sat there looking out into the open space like a pimply teenager on a date, wringing my fingers. And I could tell that she was struggling as much as I was, because she couldn''t look my way. Just hard silence between us. The seconds ticked away to the sound of popping metal, as some parts of the car cooled while others warmed in the sun.\\r\\nEventually she spoke.\\r\\n\"I''m sorry I brought you out here, Father.\"\\r\\nIt was a relief to hear her voice.\\r\\n\"That''s OK, Sheila. Tell me what''s on your mind,\" I said.\\r\\n\"It doesn''t matter. You can''t help. Don''t worry. I''ll just take you back to town. Forget about it.\" She went to turn the key in the ignition, and I leaned over to hold her hand still, to pull the key back.\\r\\nNow we were close. \"There is obviously something troubling you.\" I said, my face no more than six inches away from her nose. My hand remained on hers. \"You didn''t bring me all this way for something unimportant. Let me help you. Let me know what''s wrong.\"\\r\\n\"I''m sorry.\" she said, her green-brown eyes finally pinned on mine. \"I was wrong to ask you here. You don''t need to get involved in this. It could be bad for us. I mean, you.\"\\r\\nI removed my hand and sat back in the seat. A breeze gusted through the open window, and it felt good, fresh.\\r\\nI spoke without looking at her, ''Sheila, you have to remember that this is what I do. that I''m here to help you. It doesn''t matter how I feel, or what happens to me.\"\\r\\nI didn''t believe what I was saying either.\\r\\n\"So just let me know what you brought me out here for.\" It could have been someone else speaking.\\r\\n\"I was pregnant Father.\"\\r\\n\"I see,\" I said, still not looking back at her. \"What happened?\"\\r\\nShe turned.\\r\\n\"I got rid of it.\"\\r\\n\"Oh.\" A dribble of moisture fell across my forehead, working it''s way down my nose. I wiped my eyes with my sleeve. More silence swept through the car, as I put my broken thoughts together. The heat was getting unbearable.\\r\\n\"Are you OK? I mean, that''s what''s important. How are you?\" We were looking directly at each other now, across the seat divider, across the gearshift.\\r\\nA tear formed slowly in the cusp of her eye, a tiny bubble of pain beading against the thick mascara. \"I thought I was OK, that I''d manage. Then there was that little girl who was found. It brought it all back. I couldn''t sleep last night, I was laying in bed, sweating, thinking about what I did, about how the girl could have been mine, about how she''d be starting to walk now, how I''d be looking after her, feeding her, buying her clothes, making her pretty.\" her voice broke down into a dark cloud of sobs.\\r\\nI put my arm over her back, brought her close to me. Her soft hair caressed my chin, which I rested on the top of her head. She shook with tears.\\r\\n\"What''s done is done.\" I said, staring out into the plain.\\r\\nI was searching for guidance, for someone or something - the emptiness of the countryside, the far off blank horizon, the baked yellow grass yearning for a breeze - anything that wasn''t in the car to give me permission to fall into her, to drown myself in her warm hair, her slight body, her gentle breaths.\\r\\nBut I was lost. There was the rational part of me, the part that gets me through my life, the un-thinking right and wrong black and white good and bad just do it machine that wanted to be able to give her the same advice I''d give to anyone else, and then leave, let her deal with her own problems. Help with loving detachment. But I was there, holding her in the hot car, feeling the part of me that really makes me who I am, the part that supports my faith and informs my wonder, the parts that supplies my awe - the real God''s honest man - I was feeling that part of me trickling through my thoughts, just like my blood, and I realized how much I cared for her. How much I wanted her not to hurt. How much I really wanted her.\\r\\nShe cried some more, and spoke into my chest.\\r\\n\"I felt so worthless. So pathetic. So evil. I knew what that poor girl was going through when she left the baby there. How frightened she must have been, how terrified I was. How terrified I still am. And I lay there in my shitty little apartment, alone on my big bed as the walls just loomed in on me knowing that it can''t happen again, that I don''t want to be alone. That I need someone, someone good.\"\\r\\nShe drew away from me a little, her arms remaining close on mine, her eyes pinning me down in the seat.\\r\\n\"I don''t want to be alone, Father. Ever. I can''t stand another night like that again. I can''t go through my days trying to make the best of it, putting up, making do. Taking shit from assholes like Riley. I need someone. I need you. I''m in love with you, Father.\"\\r\\nEven though I knew what she was going to say, even though I wanted her to say it, the words still hit me hard. But I''m glad she said it first.\\r\\n\"We all need someone to love.\" I said. The words came out like a whisper in the dark.\\r\\nThe internal battle still rang through my body. I didn''t know what to say to her. Of course I wanted to tell her my truth, to let her know how much I wanted her, but I had so much to lose.\\r\\n\"You know that the Church is my life,\" I told her. \"I''ve made a commitment... I''d lose everything I''ve worked for. Everything I believe in. You know I care about you. And if things were different, if I''d made different choices. But...\"\\r\\nShe pushed her face into my neck. I could feel the tears cool against my skin, mingling with my sweat. My face remained staring out of the windscreen, as if I was another person.\\r\\n\"Some choices are too important to be thought about\" she said.\\r\\nMinutes stretched by, and I tried not to think, tried to clear my mind. Then I kissed the top of her head, keeping my face in her hair. She pulled away, and looked up, and our lips touched. Slowly.\\r\\nAnd slowly we sat there, and sat there, and kissed. And it was good.\\r\\nShe drove us back to town as the sun was falling. The buildings were glowing in golden shadows, darkness chasing light out into the street. We didn''t speak, and she left me in the diner parking lot, where we started. I was alone.\\r\\nThe dealers were in their roost, leaning and spitting and swearing. They saw me, and we stood together and apart, me watching them watching me, as the sun sank lower behind the diner, as I wondered what I was, as I struggled to move, as I struggled to leave.\\r\\nWatching, thinking, waiting for what would happen next.\\r\\nThen I stepped off the curb.\\r\\nThe first dealer''s punch hit me on my left temple, and I managed to ride it, but his second one smashed my chin and left me dazed. Then another hit me again and then kicked me, and I went down, and then all five of them were there, kicking and kicking and kicking and laughing and snorting with exertion. Then they left me and it grew dark.\\r\\nI woke again to the neon lights from Mrs. Hemingway''s store flickering over my blood on the sidewalk. Somehow I managed to stand and limp back to the church.\\r\\nAnd that''s when I found you here, Father, and asked you to hear my confession. I am here, and I confess.

With me and Sheila. With me not thinking.\\r\\nShe started to pour the water, leaning over my table. \"Hear about that baby they found, Father?\" she asked, not quite managing a smile. Her eyes looked tired.\\r\\n\"Yes, I did Sheila. Nasty business.\" I looked at her face, lingered on her warm brown breasts that nestled in the open neck of her shirt, then down to my glass. I knew she knew I looked. I think she felt sorry for me, couldn''t understand why a good looking man like myself would have ever wanted to choose to renounce sex. So I think she allowed me a quick peek for the same reasons I take disabled kids to theme parks, to give them a snatch of something different, to make them feel as if they were living a normal life. And she''s right, of course.\\r\\n\"And how are you? He''s not bothering you is he?\" I nodded upwards at Riley.\\r\\n\"Him? God no.\" she glanced back at the counter and lowered her voice. \"But there is something I need to talk to you about. I was waiting for you to come in.\"\\r\\n\"What is it? Sit down, tell me,\" I said, pointing to the space opposite.\\r\\n\"I can''t now. It''s something I can''t tell you here. Give me ten minutes and I''ll meet you at my car out front. It''s the red Camaro,\" she said.\\r\\nThen she walked her walk back to Riley, who was looking agitatedly at his empty cup.\\r\\nSheila had often asked me advice before, and I was pleased to give it. Youngish, good-looking women don''t often sit for any length of time with priests, I''m sure you know that, and I was glad of the company. And, I have to admit, I looked forward to spending time with her. Even with her problems, she''s good company. And she''s very easy on the eye. It''s got to the point where I see her just about everyday; usually when I drop into the diner in the afternoon just before her shift ends or we sometimes run into each other at Charlie''s.\\r\\nWe typically talk about some man or another, or her landlord, or an argument with her sister. Sometimes I think she exaggerates her problems just so she can talk to me, because they''re often easily solved. I just sit with her a while, give her options and lead her to pick the right one. Or sometimes we just talk. But this was different. We usually speak in public where anyone can hear us. There isn''t anything odd in a priest giving a parishioner advice, even if I do look at her a little too closely.\\r\\nI took a sip of ice water, placed the glass square on the coaster and stood up.\\r\\n\"Not eatin'' today Father?\" Riley''s snippy voice cut across the diner. He must have known there was something up. I never come in then leave.\\r\\n\"No. No, not. Um, feeling too well.\" I was always bad at lying.\\r\\n\"Well you better run off home then, Father.\"\\r\\n\"Yes. I think I will.\"\\r\\n\"See ya then.\"\\r\\n\"Yeah, I''ll see you later.\" He was only trying to make it worse for me. I wondered if he was the problem Sheila wanted to talk to me about. I hoped not.\\r\\nSheila''s car was parked over to the right of the lot, an old red Camaro, like she said, with dents and rust and dirty smears over its windscreen. The sort of car you''d expect a waitress to drive. I leant on the passenger side door while I waited, eyeing the dealers across the road. They were there again and again, day after day, the same five kids just standing, looking angry, swapping stares with me. They knew we were playing a game as much as I did, but they enjoyed it a lot more. I thought about what was going through their minds, if they ever got bored, if they felt it was worth it, if they were ever scared, like I was.\\r\\nShe came out of the diner almost running, defiling the gracefulness of her walk with an awkward shuffle, and motioned with her head to the car.\\r\\n\"Get in. It''s open.\"\\r\\nI pulled open the door and slid inside.\\r\\nShe drove us out, past the strip mall, past the last gas station for forty miles, out into the plain where the road disappears in the haze, then turned and parked behind a billboard for a new housing development. It was getting hotter, one of those strange days when the heat suddenly kicks up a notch around four, and I could feel moisture begin to drip from my forehead. But I think I would have been sweating anyway.\\r\\nThe silence was wrong. There are usually other people around us when we meet, and to be alone together was disjointed, uncomfortable. I wanted to tell her that she was in a safe place, that I''d protect her whatever her problem, but I couldn''t. I sat there looking out into the open space like a pimply teenager on a date, wringing my fingers. And I could tell that she was struggling as much as I was, because she couldn''t look my way. Just hard silence between us. The seconds ticked away to the sound of popping metal, as some parts of the car cooled while others warmed in the sun.\\r\\nEventually she spoke.\\r\\n\"I''m sorry I brought you out here, Father.\"\\r\\nIt was a relief to hear her voice.\\r\\n\"That''s OK, Sheila. Tell me what''s on your mind,\" I said.\\r\\n\"It doesn''t matter. You can''t help. Don''t worry. I''ll just take you back to town. Forget about it.\" She went to turn the key in the ignition, and I leaned over to hold her hand still, to pull the key back.\\r\\nNow we were close. \"There is obviously something troubling you.\" I said, my face no more than six inches away from her nose. My hand remained on hers. \"You didn''t bring me all this way for something unimportant. Let me help you. Let me know what''s wrong.\"\\r\\n\"I''m sorry.\" she said, her green-brown eyes finally pinned on mine. \"I was wrong to ask you here. You don''t need to get involved in this. It could be bad for us. I mean, you.\"\\r\\nI removed my hand and sat back in the seat. A breeze gusted through the open window, and it felt good, fresh.\\r\\nI spoke without looking at her, ''Sheila, you have to remember that this is what I do. that I''m here to help you. It doesn''t matter how I feel, or what happens to me.\"\\r\\nI didn''t believe what I was saying either.\\r\\n\"So just let me know what you brought me out here for.\" It could have been someone else speaking.\\r\\n\"I was pregnant Father.\"\\r\\n\"I see,\" I said, still not looking back at her. \"What happened?\"\\r\\nShe turned.\\r\\n\"I got rid of it.\"\\r\\n\"Oh.\" A dribble of moisture fell across my forehead, working it''s way down my nose. I wiped my eyes with my sleeve. More silence swept through the car, as I put my broken thoughts together. The heat was getting unbearable.\\r\\n\"Are you OK? I mean, that''s what''s important. How are you?\" We were looking directly at each other now, across the seat divider, across the gearshift.\\r\\nA tear formed slowly in the cusp of her eye, a tiny bubble of pain beading against the thick mascara. \"I thought I was OK, that I''d manage. Then there was that little girl who was found. It brought it all back. I couldn''t sleep last night, I was laying in bed, sweating, thinking about what I did, about how the girl could have been mine, about how she''d be starting to walk now, how I''d be looking after her, feeding her, buying her clothes, making her pretty.\" her voice broke down into a dark cloud of sobs.\\r\\nI put my arm over her back, brought her close to me. Her soft hair caressed my chin, which I rested on the top of her head. She shook with tears.\\r\\n\"What''s done is done.\" I said, staring out into the plain.\\r\\nI was searching for guidance, for someone or something - the emptiness of the countryside, the far off blank horizon, the baked yellow grass yearning for a breeze - anything that wasn''t in the car to give me permission to fall into her, to drown myself in her warm hair, her slight body, her gentle breaths.\\r\\nBut I was lost. There was the rational part of me, the part that gets me through my life, the un-thinking right and wrong black and white good and bad just do it machine that wanted to be able to give her the same advice I''d give to anyone else, and then leave, let her deal with her own problems. Help with loving detachment. But I was there, holding her in the hot car, feeling the part of me that really makes me who I am, the part that supports my faith and informs my wonder, the parts that supplies my awe - the real God''s honest man - I was feeling that part of me trickling through my thoughts, just like my blood, and I realized how much I cared for her. How much I wanted her not to hurt. How much I really wanted her.\\r\\nShe cried some more, and spoke into my chest.\\r\\n\"I felt so worthless. So pathetic. So evil. I knew what that poor girl was going through when she left the baby there. How frightened she must have been, how terrified I was. How terrified I still am. And I lay there in my shitty little apartment, alone on my big bed as the walls just loomed in on me knowing that it can''t happen again, that I don''t want to be alone. That I need someone, someone good.\"\\r\\nShe drew away from me a little, her arms remaining close on mine, her eyes pinning me down in the seat.\\r\\n\"I don''t want to be alone, Father. Ever. I can''t stand another night like that again. I can''t go through my days trying to make the best of it, putting up, making do. Taking shit from assholes like Riley. I need someone. I need you. I''m in love with you, Father.\"\\r\\nEven though I knew what she was going to say, even though I wanted her to say it, the words still hit me hard. But I''m glad she said it first.\\r\\n\"We all need someone to love.\" I said. The words came out like a whisper in the dark.\\r\\nThe internal battle still rang through my body. I didn''t know what to say to her. Of course I wanted to tell her my truth, to let her know how much I wanted her, but I had so much to lose.\\r\\n\"You know that the Church is my life,\" I told her. \"I''ve made a commitment... I''d lose everything I''ve worked for. Everything I believe in. You know I care about you. And if things were different, if I''d made different choices. But...\"\\r\\nShe pushed her face into my neck. I could feel the tears cool against my skin, mingling with my sweat. My face remained staring out of the windscreen, as if I was another person.\\r\\n\"Some choices are too important to be thought about\" she said.\\r\\nMinutes stretched by, and I tried not to think, tried to clear my mind. Then I kissed the top of her head, keeping my face in her hair. She pulled away, and looked up, and our lips touched. Slowly.\\r\\nAnd slowly we sat there, and sat there, and kissed. And it was good.\\r\\nShe drove us back to town as the sun was falling. The buildings were glowing in golden shadows, darkness chasing light out into the street. We didn''t speak, and she left me in the diner parking lot, where we started. I was alone.\\r\\nThe dealers were in their roost, leaning and spitting and swearing. They saw me, and we stood together and apart, me watching them watching me, as the sun sank lower behind the diner, as I wondered what I was, as I struggled to move, as I struggled to leave.\\r\\nWatching, thinking, waiting for what would happen next.\\r\\nThen I stepped off the curb.\\r\\nThe first dealer''s punch hit me on my left temple, and I managed to ride it, but his second one smashed my chin and left me dazed. Then another hit me again and then kicked me, and I went down, and then all five of them were there, kicking and kicking and kicking and laughing and snorting with exertion. Then they left me and it grew dark.\\r\\nI woke again to the neon lights from Mrs. Hemingway''s store flickering over my blood on the sidewalk. Somehow I managed to stand and limp back to the church.\\r\\nAnd that''s when I found you here, Father, and asked you to hear my confession. I am here, and I confess. I have sinned.\r\n', 'Not Waving Goodbye, Saying Hello by Martin Bell', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', '6-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-08-11 12:33:51', '2016-08-11 20:33:51', '', 6, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/6-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Her hair, stirring in the wind, runs over her bare shoulders. I want to put my arm around her but that’s not how we are. Perhaps I would if we were boyfriend-girlfriend, not best friends.\\r\\nThe full moon makes Jordan appear washed-out, her blonde hair a shocking shade of white. Her cheekbones seem to jut out worse than usual, giving her a skeletal fashion. I know I look just as bad - nobody looks good at night.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n‘How was your day?’ she asks, giving me a furtive glance before going back to her cigarette. The smoke appears to be a blue-grey mist that winds away from her frail hand and twirls up to the stars.\\r\\nI drop my gaze to my lap. ‘Doesn’t matter,’ I murmur, wrapping my battered arms around myself. It’s cold out tonight.\\r\\nJordan doesn’t respond, just meekly tucks a stray chunk of hair behind one ear. Out of the corner of my eye I can see the purple welt on her temple. It looks fresh; she probably got it just this morning, coupled with others. We don’t talk about those things.\\r\\nShe finishes her cigarette and flicks one slender wrist, tossing the butt over her shoulder, over the edge. Her favorite bracelet, beads of green that match her eyes, jangles timidly. It was my fourteenth birthday present to her.\\r\\n‘Listen,’ she crawls over to me and presses a finger to the corner of my mouth, next to a faded scar.\\r\\nWe’re silent, straining to hear the cars rumble by, more than a dozen stories below. She informs me she heard it, her large eyes blinking slowly.\\r\\nIt was a game we used to play while our fathers were sleeping off their hangovers; throwing things off the building and estimating how long it would take to hit the ground and pretending we could hear them. Jordan always heard the splat before I did. Childish, but it stuck with us. Everyone remembers the most unimportant things in his or her childhood.\\r\\nJordan straightens from her crouch; late-night moisture clings to her flimsy shirt. She brushes dirt off her pants and walks over to our potted plants, twenty or so, resting on an old card table. At an apartment with God-knows-how-many people, it’s surprising there are just a few who venture out to the roof. Jordan and I''ve planted flowers every spring since we were eleven and never have much trouble keeping them alive. No one destroys them.\\r\\n‘Too bad there’ll be no flowers next year...’ Jordan pushes her finger into the dark soil filling the cheap plastic. ‘They’re kind of pretty.’ She plucks the flower from its stem. A small petal floats to her palm and she brings it close to her face to blow away. She sets about removing the other petals.\\r\\nSeeing my friend destroy something we’d done together makes me feel slightly nauseous. I realize I soon have to tell her I’m backing out of our plan. She catches me fidgeting with my jacket zipper. Our eyes meet and my hands pause, mid-zip. My fingers are freezing on the metal. She studies my face.\\r\\n‘You asshole,’ she whispers, her face crumpling. She drops the remaining bit of blossom. ‘You said we’d go together.’\\r\\nI twist around and peek over the edge of the building, to the masses of life below. ‘I just can’t... when --’ I pause to think. ‘We’re going about this the wrong way, Jordan. Why don’t we just run away?’\\r\\n‘Because that doesn’t end anything, Paul!’ she cries.\\r\\nI turn back to her. ‘Yeah, and this doesn’t solve anything!’\\r\\n‘Don’t tell me you’d rather keep living like this, Daddy’s little play-thing? You enjoy it?’\\r\\nHer words strike me but I silently forgive her; she’s angry and doesn’t want me to know she understands. But she does.\\r\\nI remain calm. ‘You think I enjoy my father...'' Refusing to let the words form on my lips, I continue. ''I don’t like it any more than you do.’ She flinches, her hand raising to her bruised temple. ‘We could call someone...’\\r\\nJordan’s eyes narrow to slits. ‘Been through this part, Paul. I refuse to be a runaway or foster child. Neither has a good life. This is bad enough; I don’t want it any worse. I’m going...’ her voice lowers and her face softens. ‘And if you’re not coming --’ She fumbles with the catch on her bracelet, steps towards me and clasps it on my wrist.\\r\\nI can feel the much-expected tears well up but I blink them away. ‘I just can’t. I’m going to call someone for myself... tonight. I’d rather be a foster kid.’\\r\\nJordan doesn’t speak so I plunge ahead. ‘You knew all along that I’d back out,’ I say.\\r\\nShe nods. ‘Yeah. I did.’ She stuffs her hands into her faded blue-jeans pockets and strides back over to the ledge. She’s shivering again. Or is it still? I didn’t notice if she had stopped. One sneakered foot raises up, then the other.\\r\\nShe doesn’t hesitate and I don’t wait around. This isn’t a game; I know I’ll hear something hit the pavement. I fling open the heavy steel door to the apartment’s dim interior, dash inside, down the stairs, more stairs. By the time I reach the frigid outdoors, there’s a crowd gathering. I push my way through, lungs feeling as though they’ll burst.\\r\\nSweat drips down my forehead, clings to my upper lip and I raise a hand to wipe it away. Jordan''s bracelet slides along my wrist. I remain fixed to the spot, practically boring a hole into her head before heading to the phone-booth down the street.\\r\\nAll I can think is I was wrong.

Crumbs stab into my elbows; their shadows stretch across the vinyl tablecloth, revealing them in clusters. Between him and me are the sports section and his slice of cold pizza. I cringe at another sip.\\r\\nHe gives me a prolonged look over the top of his shield and then turns the page, wafting his woody-spicy cologne my way. It burns my lungs and makes me a warped sort of hungry.\\r\\n\"I''m brushing,\" I explain.\\r\\nEverything in our bedroom-the maroon shag, the itchy mauve quilt, the ribbed taupe curtains-exudes that woody-spicy stink. The wet dog smell from the clothesbasket on the closet floor adds even more bite to the pungent aroma of the room. Only the antique bureau, swelling out like a baroque museum piece with claw feet and teardrop knobs, is able to protect my socks and bras and sweatpants from absorbing it all.\\r\\n\"What, your hygienist been threatening you?\"\\r\\nWe promised each other we''d never lose the drive--that we''d move cross-country to California and sell T-shirts and surf boards in a little shop on the beach--that we''d never come back. I always think maybe if we leave right now we could still escape. He would lose the weight and his hair would grow in the right places again and his eyes would open as wide as they used to; I''d sleep less and drink more and touch things again with the tips of my fingers.\\r\\nHe downs his coffee and heads off early to work. When the kitchen air clears, that familiar kitty litter odor returns-even though we have no cat. I wash last night''s dishes, watch carved-off bits of chicken fat and overripe broccoli heads swim in slow-motion rewind to the drain as if they were meant to be there all along, then go to work myself.\\r\\n---\\r\\nWith the afterimage of the computer screen burnt into my retinas, my voice strained from the customer service falsetto, and a point on the left side of my skull, behind the ear, throbbing from the too-tight headset, I drive to the pharmacy. It smells pleasantly sterile and the carpets are gray. There are rows of floss, pre- and post-rinses, picks and pokers. I choose a little of everything and continue home.\\r\\nThe TV projects varying hues, sad and happy, across the living room. Despite that, his boxer-briefs and wife beater and bowl of stale popcorn bathe in an eerily constant blue. He is stubbled and his eyes are scuffed beads.\\r\\nI go to the bathroom and whisk the shower curtain closed; I''d rather see the shadows of soap scum on the liner than the paint peeling on the shower windowsill or the torn shade or the dingy traction mat. I tape my pamphlet to the mirror and spend the night learning to use everything. I ignore the tiny square tiles all over the floor and the walls so I don''t get caught up in their complicated patterns. I pretend I can''t smell his Garden Fresh disinfectant spray hanging in the air, though I sneeze every few minutes anyway. By midnight, my gums ache and all I can taste is strong mint mixed with traces of blood. I am done.\\r\\nWhen I go to bed he is lying on his back: still awake. I try to change my clothes, but I can''t find the right drawer--every teardrop feels the same--and I decide not to bother. I stub my toe on the bedpost, and the pain swells back on me as I crawl in. He turns his head and says, \"My brother once got on some brushing kick. Brushed off all his enamel. Fourteen cavities.\" Then he thumps over onto his side, having made his point, and I know he''s asleep when his breathing turns light, steady--like a child''s.\\r\\nI''m thankful we never installed that mirror on the ceiling like we dreamed we would while we were dating--while we were kissing under feathered down and tangled in each other''s arms, when we would tumble into bed from any side and sleep wherever we landed--so I don''t have to see us now, tranquil as corpses in the sallow morning light, and I''ll never wake to witness myself gripping the edge of the mattress after I''ve tripped down that fjord in my nightmares, my body tensing and my face twisted as if I''m still about to plunge into those icy Nordic waters.\\r\\n---\\r\\nIn the morning, my mouth feels coated with dirt. Orange juice is acid on an open wound. But over the next nights, the red trails against the white sink fade to pink and then to clear. He is awake when I come to bed, but his remarks wither to huffs, then to heavy sighs.\\r\\nAs I wait him out, I think about how we used to laugh at couples that look like we do now.\\r\\nI remember how, amidst the scent of gardenias and the endless Canon in D of our wedding day, he seemed to let out one long breath--how his tuxedo, the one he wore when he proposed over that dinner of swordfish in light lemon crème, began to crease in rays of strain at the buttons to form a column of dark comets--and how fast it happened--sometime after the vows, perhaps around the time his mother unveiled four pans of coffee cake in a curious substitution for the frosted three-tier double mocha I''d expected, or as late as when we dragged ourselves across the sticky summer leather of the limousine for that final ride to the airport.\\r\\nI try to picture him young, but the wispy hologram is a film so thin it pops with the slightest pressure--a movement, a breath. I try to fantasize about leaving him, about being left by him, about us agreeing with a handshake to leave each other, but it stops there. I can''t dream up a life to follow.\\r\\nHe comes home late holding a portable, wind-up clock. The hands have phosphorescent strips and the sticker on the face is creased into a liquid-looking line that meanders from the II to the VII.\\r\\n\"What''s that for?\"\\r\\n\"The bathroom.\"\\r\\n\"Why?\"\\r\\n\"Time my showers.\" He has never taken a shower more than seven minutes long. \"I''ll just put it here,\" on the middle shelf of the wicker wall rack, atop a stack of navy face cloths. He sprays his disinfectant and its fierce Garden Freshness sends me into a sneezing fit.\\r\\nI do end up creating some uses for the clock. Countdown starts the moment I hear him drag his feet down the hallway, over the pharmacy-gray industrial carpeting, past the bathroom and into the bedroom. While time runs, I do other things: wash my face, brush my hair. I overlook the navy blue lint on the rim of the tub, the grime behind the toilet, the lush mold inside the sink''s flood hole. Forty-two minutes later, he is undoubtedly asleep--limp on the mattress.\\r\\nThen, I can begin:\\r\\nFirst, I rinse with a mildly minty plaque-loosener (2 minutes); next, I brush teeth, tongue, gums, lips--everywhere--with baking soda toothpaste (26 minutes); then I floss, twenty-three strokes per gap: ten against each tooth, three sweeping the gum in between (19 minutes); and last, I gargle with a mouthwash that makes my eyes tear, my face burn-so strong in my throat it blocks out the Garden Fresh stench (2 minutes).\\r\\nI grow more accustomed to the bedroom darkness, learning to count my steps to the bureau, to feel for nicks in the wood, to find pajamas by the texture of the fabrics. Soon, I undress and dress and maneuver as though I never needed eyes at all.\\r\\n---\\r\\nHe eats leftover meatloaf slathered in ketchup for breakfast. His temples have seemed to swell and stretch and merge under the skin on his forehead, and the lump rises and falls when he chews; he resembles a feeding gorilla.\\r\\nThough groggy, I try to remember if my change happened before or after his--whether I was the cause or the effect.\\r\\nWhile I rummage for the milk, I notice a pair of never-used pomegranate candles, in block-crystal bases, buried in the nook between the fridge and the breadbox. I used to wear red like that on my lips--that same bright shade. I could never wear it now, knowing how easily lipstick stains--but I wonder what I''d look like. I wonder how pomegranate floss would taste.\\r\\nBefore I add milk to my raisin bran, I pick out the raisins--knowing how readily they catch between the teeth--and they sit like a deposit of frosted rabbit pellets on my napkin. Since I began waking up before him to gargle, my appetite has returned--the mouthwash mint is intense enough to temper his cologne, though not enough to smother it. The metal spoon resting on my middle finger cools the spot where my skin is starting to dry and peel from the floss.\\r\\n---\\r\\nAt 1:34 a.m., he knocks. I freeze.\\r\\nI open the door. He is sitting the wrong way on a kitchen chair--straddling it, leaning forward against its back-facing the bathroom door. I never even heard him out there.\\r\\n\"Do you have to use the bathroom?\"\\r\\nHe glares at me. \"Yeah.\" There is a blanched sliver of food between his front teeth.\\r\\n\"Here. Use it.\" I step out. The floss is cutting off blood flow to the tips of my middle fingers.\\r\\n\"After you.\" The food is still there, harbored in that crevice.\\r\\nI step back in. \"You''re just gonna sit there and watch me?\"\\r\\n\"Yeah.\" He wouldn''t bother to get rid of it even if I told him it was there.\\r\\nWe stare at each other. His face and neck are blackened with bristly hair. Weak pulses of blood magnify into painful throbs at my purple fingertips. His thighs bulge off the edge of the seat.\\r\\nIn a flash I grab the knob, and before he can heave himself up and jam his swollen slippered foot in the gap, I have it locked. He slams into the door, somewhere up high--with his fists, or his elbows, or his entire lower arm--and the sound fills the bathroom, resonating in the ceramics.\\r\\nRight away I release the chokehold and soothe my fingers under cool water. I hear the chair bruise the walls as he lugs it back to the kitchen, then his slipper tread rasp against the rug in weary steps through the hallway toward the bedroom... then no noise, and I am safe.\\r\\nAfter my fingers recover, I finish flossing-and I add extra strokes, just to be sure. Then I brush again, massaging every flesh surface, stripping away anything dead I may have left the first time. The mirror reflects a flush, clear-eyed face; my lips seem fuller, darker.\\r\\nWhen I go to the bedroom, I take time to appreciate the scratched wood, the sad cold knobs, the weaves of the fabric. While I''m exposed in the dark, I take time to stretch, to knead, to memorize the softness of my skin.\\r\\n---\\r\\nI''m flossing between the top left canine and lateral incisor when I spot a single stubble hair in the sink-not quite a centimeter long. I run the water, but it won''t wash down. I use the blunt end of my brush. Then the bristled end of his. My fingernail finally does the trick. I clean my finger with antibacterial hand soap, then I clean the sink with a wad of toilet paper. Then I dry my hands, and I look around.\\r\\nThe first thing to go is the Garden Fresh disinfectant spray. Hoping to neutralize any lurking hint of it, I wrap Gardenia potpourri in gauze and hang it everywhere: the doorknob, the window lock, the sink drainpipes. I replace everything navy--the face cloths, the bath towels, the shaggy rug, the fuzzy toilet seat cover--with white lint-free things never drenched in Garden Freshness. I cut the curtain liner down and tear away the traction mat-the suction sounds like packing bubbles popping. I scour the tiles on the walls and floor with lemony-pine cleaners. With a mixture of bleach and baking soda, I polish the tub, then the toilet, then the sink; I add some to the bristles when I use his brush to scrub inside the flood hole.\\r\\nWhen I step into the tub to toss out the torn shade and re-paint the flaking sill, I notice the moon, high up and pale as bone. I open the window. The cool night air falls in, and trees rustle outside. I discover that if I stand here in the tub, and it''s past a certain hour, I can always see the moon--so every night I open the window to wait for it.\\r\\n---\\r\\nWhenever the clothesbasket overflows, whenever he drapes his belts over the back of the recliner, whenever he spills beer on the living room Oriental, whenever he brands the light switch with grease-prints--I leave things as they are. The distinct odors of the house worsen as neglected rooms surrender and deteriorate, but my bathroom stays pristine.\\r\\nI walk on the cold bathroom tiles barefoot now, and my dreams take me to the bathhouses of ancient Pompeii instead of the Norwegian Sea. When I crouch to study the festive mesh of green mint and red cinnamon floss at the top of the trash, I catch myself humming carols the next morning. The curled-up toothpaste tube begins to remind me of a young ballerina on her tummy, stretching her toes to her head.\\r\\nSometimes I floss leaning against the newly satin-finished sill, and I tell the moon that I was once a dancer-that when I was seven, I would pirouette for hours--I would sleep in my tutu. Then I extend my arms through the window, as I once would have in third arabesque, to floss between the moon and the sky--to scrape away the parched, ancient craters--and again I can imagine myself a prima ballerina princess.\\r\\nAnd only very late at night, when the trees have quieted and the door is locked and the window is open wide, the moon talks back to me. It tells me how dizzy it gets, how it questions its purpose.\\r\\n---\\r\\nA sudden snap.\\r\\nThe roller keeps spinning, and the last of the white unwaxed floss--about five inches--droops from my fist. It was my last reel, my spare.\\r\\nI have no choice. I gargle, shut the window, and leave the bathroom. The neighbors'' driveway light streams through the Venetian blinds in the bedroom like so many suns, a prison stripe spotlight for me as I tiptoe in.\\r\\nHe is on his back. I undress and dress awkwardly, shrinking away from the bright bands, thinking that he could see me exposed at any moment--but he does not sit up, does not open his eyes. I sneak into bed, stare at the ceiling and wait.\\r\\nI listen to the irregular rhythm of his breathing, but it never steadies, never strengthens. Other than that, the room is black and silent. I can feel the threads of cotton on the back of my arms and neck.\\r\\nThe light in the neighbors'' driveway clicks off. In the void above I catch glimpses of the ghosts of the veins inside and behind my eyes, cast in strange pulsing yellows that move with me no matter where I look.\\r\\nI close my eyes, turn to my side and try to force sleep. Despite the mint in my throat and on my tongue, I smell his cologne deep in the fibers of my pillow, where it will seep into my skin overnight. I hear my own blood coursing in spurts through my ears. The bed seems both incalculably large and small. My teeth are slick against my tongue, but I know gritty sugars linger in places I never reached. Before long, bacteria will consume the sugars and produce acids, then the acids will sear the soft tissue at my gumline, dissolve the minerals in my enamel, dig further for the dentin, then the pulp...\\r\\nHe rolls toward me. It takes him years. \"What''s the problem?\"\\r\\n\"Ran out of floss. Can''t finish.\"\\r\\nHe lets out a long breath--so long I think he might deflate. \"So go and get more.\" He eases himself back over, no thumping or huffing. His breathing becomes shallow and regular within seconds.\\r\\nNow that it''s dark I can dress quickly, counting nicks and knobs, sorting through piles of familiar materials, pulling things on and over, zipping up and buttoning down. I smile as I go, admiring my own adeptness. I find his wallet in the pants on top of the dirty clothes mound, which is waist-high and spilling three feet out from the closet.\\r\\nThe night air has made the car door handle cold. I pull out, shivering with the moon by my shoulder but expecting the sun on my back soon enough. I don''t worry about leaving my toothbrush behind. I''ll buy a new one in San Diego.', 'Scraping Craters by Nancy Callahan', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', '10-revision-v1', '', '', '2008-09-30 09:47:24', '2008-09-30 17:47:24', '', 10, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/10-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The white walls are saturated with the charred smell of old drilling.\\r\\nShe peppers her story with warnings like \"Not flossing when you brush is like not washing your armpits when you shower\" while clamping my tongue down with a nickel-sized mirror and grazing a pick along my gum line in deft arcs.

The distinct odors of the house worsen as neglected rooms surrender and deteriorate, but my bathroom stays pristine.\\r\\nI walk on the cold bathroom tiles barefoot now, and my dreams take me to the bathhouses of ancient Pompeii instead of the Norwegian Sea. When I crouch to study the festive mesh of green mint and red cinnamon floss at the top of the trash, I catch myself humming carols the next morning. The curled-up toothpaste tube begins to remind me of a young ballerina on her tummy, stretching her toes to her head.\\r\\nSometimes I floss leaning against the newly satin-finished sill, and I tell the moon that I was once a dancer-that when I was seven, I would pirouette for hours--I would sleep in my tutu. Then I extend my arms through the window, as I once would have in third arabesque, to floss between the moon and the sky--to scrape away the parched, ancient craters--and again I can imagine myself a prima ballerina princess.\\r\\nAnd only very late at night, when the trees have quieted and the door is locked and the window is open wide, the moon talks back to me. It tells me how dizzy it gets, how it questions its purpose.\\r\\n---\\r\\nA sudden snap.\\r\\nThe roller keeps spinning, and the last of the white unwaxed floss--about five inches--droops from my fist. It was my last reel, my spare.\\r\\nI have no choice. I gargle, shut the window, and leave the bathroom. The neighbors'' driveway light streams through the Venetian blinds in the bedroom like so many suns, a prison stripe spotlight for me as I tiptoe in.\\r\\nHe is on his back. I undress and dress awkwardly, shrinking away from the bright bands, thinking that he could see me exposed at any moment--but he does not sit up, does not open his eyes. I sneak into bed, stare at the ceiling and wait.\\r\\nI listen to the irregular rhythm of his breathing, but it never steadies, never strengthens. Other than that, the room is black and silent. I can feel the threads of cotton on the back of my arms and neck.\\r\\nThe light in the neighbors'' driveway clicks off. In the void above I catch glimpses of the ghosts of the veins inside and behind my eyes, cast in strange pulsing yellows that move with me no matter where I look.\\r\\nI close my eyes, turn to my side and try to force sleep. Despite the mint in my throat and on my tongue, I smell his cologne deep in the fibers of my pillow, where it will seep into my skin overnight. I hear my own blood coursing in spurts through my ears. The bed seems both incalculably large and small. My teeth are slick against my tongue, but I know gritty sugars linger in places I never reached. Before long, bacteria will consume the sugars and produce acids, then the acids will sear the soft tissue at my gumline, dissolve the minerals in my enamel, dig further for the dentin, then the pulp...\\r\\nHe rolls toward me. It takes him years. \"What''s the problem?\"\\r\\n\"Ran out of floss. Can''t finish.\"\\r\\nHe lets out a long breath--so long I think he might deflate. \"So go and get more.\" He eases himself back over, no thumping or huffing. His breathing becomes shallow and regular within seconds.\\r\\nNow that it''s dark I can dress quickly, counting nicks and knobs, sorting through piles of familiar materials, pulling things on and over, zipping up and buttoning down. I smile as I go, admiring my own adeptness. I find his wallet in the pants on top of the dirty clothes mound, which is waist-high and spilling three feet out from the closet.\\r\\nThe night air has made the car door handle cold. I pull out, shivering with the moon by my shoulder but expecting the sun on my back soon enough. I don''t worry about leaving my toothbrush behind.

Certainly this part of the world, a bus stop near a doughnut-and-coffee place, its walls sticky red in the sun, with its pool tables and Pacheco. It was where T.V judges passing sentence inaudibly in the background made sense. In front, trucks roared by and grit lay in little heaps at the side of the road. There was nothing for the eye to rest on, and therefore, few places for the mind to find peace.\\r\\nThe man was talking to himself, or perhaps, to someone I couldn’t see. I couldn’t make out the language, perhaps it was Bengali, or another Indian language, in which he was seemingly explaining himself, going through lists, and spitting. Little dry spits like a boy who has just discovered how to and keeps doing it to try to be a man, except he was a man, and had gray hair.\\r\\nNo one else seemed interested. Waiting for the bus was enough. Meanwhile, I watched. The man was middle aged, comfortably dressed in clean casual clothes, and occasionally he ran his fingers quickly through his hair, as if his scalp was crawling. He kept up a steady stream of talk that, whether he intended it or no, kept everyone at bay. He cast his eyes from side to side, and catching a glimpse of them I saw they were sad and tired, rather than crazed, and there were great distances in them. The hand passed through the hair again, and I could see the nails were slightly long but clean, so he cared for himself, or had others who would do so, perhaps family members moved by compassion, hoping to do all they could for this man.\\r\\nWhat had brought him to this place from the distant land of his ancestors? Was it just curiosity, or love, or work which led him here only for him to find it slipping from him, causing this retreat behind a wall of soft, rapid murmuring? The harsh Californian light was directly overhead, making shadows shrink and picking out all the grit and rubbish underfoot. The lines in every face at the bus stop were visible and deep.\\r\\nWas he in hell, or was he seeking a sweet place, as we all stood waiting for the number 19 bus. I pictured buses as they moved along country roads in India, kicking up dust and passing cars spattered with colored powder from the Holi celebrations. In a crossroads schoolhouse, seen as if through a thick wall of glass, an aging teacher stood by a blackboard covered in formulae, a beam of light illuminating tiny swirls of dust that continued in their orbits in front of his spotless white shirt. “Well…?” and the teacher leaned forward for an answer.\\r\\nThe bus arrived, and we all got on, proffering dollars or passes as we hurried for a seat. Again the man was ahead of me, so I kept seeing the clean hand running restlessly through the thick, graying hair. I hoped the man got home safely. Although no one showed any antipathy, I wondered how it would turn out if the stranger had asked someone for help.\\r\\nAgain, images came out of the air. Horns blared as a tangled mass of cars, bikes, and an isolated bullock cart moved off from a busy intersection. Under a huge poster advertising the latest romantic comedy, a youth had spread a cloth on the sidewalk, and joined by two companions, set up a brisk, trebly rhythm. They faltered for a moment, and the leader, hardly out of boyhood though he tried to be more, looked at his companions with a hint of irritation. The boy with wavy hair and taut grin started again on his little drum, and the third member of the company, a child playing a sort of one string harp, held his instrument aloft for a moment and shuffled around nervously. The leader struck a note on his lute, spun round on the toes of one foot, and howled out in anguish and a terrible solitude.\\r\\nPassersby gave some coins; some left food, and some smiled and watched the impassioned pleas to God and charity under the fierce Indian sun. A hundred yards away, another sad-eyed youngster gritted his teeth and longed for lessons to finish, so he could escape from the crowded streets to play cricket.\\r\\nHere on the bus there was much less to take someone’s thoughts from the grind of the mundane. Misanthropes informed anyone who was within earshot about the latest stand they were taking. Men who couldn’t fasten their trousers told everyone where they were going wrong. Others incessantly related minute details of their personal lives.\\r\\nWhere was the stranger now? Had he tried to withdraw to a far-off place, or was he just saying bad things about his workmates, the bus driver, and the library service? I saw his head move as he continued to talk, and the bus moved on. I got off before him, and I remembered him for a long time.\\r\\nThe other day I was going up an escalator, he was descending on the opposite side, and the moment I saw him I remembered the long wait for the bus the first time I had seen him. This time he was a little grayer, and wasn’t saying a word. The first time I saw him, I have strong suspicions, he was just having a bad day.\r\nfiction ', 'The Man With Gray Hair by Mark Stewart Cassidy', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', '12-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-08-12 12:00:15', '2016-08-12 20:00:15', '', 12, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/12-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

The tar surface was hot and soft to the touch, and he liked the smell of it. There were no cars on the road. Only three people in the whole street owned a car, and they were away somewhere, probably at work, he supposed. He closed his eyes, and the world became orange. He thought of his dog, Bonzo, who was orange and white. The dog had a way of trotting at an angle, which the boy admired very much. Sometimes he tried to walk like that himself.\\r\\nThe boy opened his eyes just as a red and black butterfly flitted across the road. The boy, whose name was Sam, let his thoughts float after it. He thought about the Raymond gang, which had a membership of four; Raymond Chine, Stuart, Sam himself, and his brother Keith. The two boys were very comfortable with each other, although in fact they were not really brothers, or even related. They were, however, equally stubborn. When Gill bought them a cricket set, consisting of two bats, some stumps and a ball, the boys took it all down to Valentine''s Park and had a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours. When it was time to go home, they were both tired, and neither one wanted to carry the equipment back up the hill which lead to home. After some argument, Keith left it on a low coping wall for Sam to pick up. Sam left it there, expecting Keith to go back for it. When they got home, Gill sent them back for it, but by that time, of course, it had gone.\\r\\nSam was a sort of out-rider for the gang. When someone said, \"I dare you\", they all knew he was the one who would carry out the dare. The boys sensed a kind of wildness in Sam, which set him a little apart from them; \"I dare you to climb to the top of that tree\", \"I dare you to lift that lady''s skirt\", or put pennies on the railway line for the train to flatten out, or jump off the bus while it was moving. Once he even took a half crown from Auntie Eva''s purse. He took it to the local sweetshop but he had no idea what to buy with it. The shopkeeper took him back home. Auntie Eva gently explained to him that it was wrong to take money without asking. She didn''t seem angry, and she didn''t scold him. He felt so ashamed that he promised himself he would never do anything like that again.\\r\\nSam had been with the Draysons since he was three years old. Before that he had lived a very long way away, in Scotland, with his mother. He had no memories of that time, but Eva and Gill Drayson sometimes mentioned it. Auntie Eva told him that his mother had been on her own, and that times had been hard because of the war. She said that his mother had to go into the farmer''s fields at night sometimes, to steal turnips; otherwise they might both have starved. Sam didn''t really think about things like that, but he stored it away somewhere at the back of his mind, as something to mull over when he was older, and could perhaps understand it.\\r\\nRight now he had more interesting things to think about. Like Deirdre Ross, for instance. She always seemed to know more about the mysterious world of grown-ups than did the boys. She wasn''t part of the Raymond gang, but often hung around with the boys, who tolerated her because of the indefinable air she carried, of knowing more about the way the world worked than they did. Yesterday she had told the boys that she knew a secret. \"Keep it under your hat, boys, but I know where babies come from\", she confided in a stage whisper, and pointed vaguely towards her tummy. Sam thought of a baby in a hat. A top hat. It was all a bit confusing, and he added it to his list of things to mull over at a later stage.\\r\\nSam let the sun soak into him. Could life get any better? High up, a single-engine airplane droned slowly across the sky, the sound getting fainter as it moved away. He watched it until it disappeared. He remembered that he had asked Uncle Gill if there would ever be another war. Gill had been mending a shoe on an iron last. He looked at Sam. \"I hope not, boy,\" he said. The war had ended three years ago. On the rare occasions that he had been taken to visit his mother in London, Sam had seen the bombsights which still littered the streets, looking like missing teeth. There were more fields then streets where the Draysons lived, and there had been no bombing raids here in the war, but still, Sam thought, if there were another war, the Germans might concentrate on his area next time.\\r\\nHe thought about his house disappearing with a loud bang, and Bonzo running down the street with his funny sideways gait, and his tail between his legs. He tried to imagine the street without his house in it, and couldn''t. The house was all he knew; the kitchen where Auntie Eva placed him on the sideboard and scrubbed his face and knees with a flannel at teatime, the dining room with the big radio and the brown tiled fireplace, and the front room with the piano, which nobody ever went into. The main bedroom upstairs, which belonged to Eva and Gill, had a clock on the wall which was taller than Sam, and was operated by a system of weights and chains. Sam never really understood anything at all about that clock.\\r\\nThere were two other bedrooms; one for the girls, Tommy and Pam, and the box room at the end of the passage, which was shared by Keith and Sam. Next door lived Raymond Chine, the nominal leader of the Raymond gang, although Keith was the real leader. Raymond''s father was a bus conductor, but Gill Drayson was a bus driver, which was far superior. Once a woman had thrown herself in front of his bus. Gill stopped the bus inches from her head. When the company measured the skid, they decided to give him an award for quick thinking. The boys were very proud of that.\\r\\nSam heard a car turn into the road, and decided to sit up. The road shimmered in the heat of the afternoon. The car, a small black Austin, drove slowly down the road and disappeared around the corner, leaving a smell of exhaust fumes in the air. Sam considered his options. He could find the gang and see if they wanted to go over to the Crooked Billet farm, and throw stones at the windows of the abandoned farmhouse. Or he could see if he could catch a lizard in the field behind the street, although you really needed two for that - one to distract the lizard and one to creep up behind and catch it before it disappeared in the long grass. Or he could just lie down on the road again and look at the sun through his fingers. Yes, that would be the best plan. It must be teatime soon, and they would probably send Bonzo out to look for him. He thought about Bonzo''s funny walk, and smiled.\\r\\n<em>James Donaldson Collins started writing articles and essays about two years ago, as a relaxation from his work as a pet portrait artist, guitar teacher, dog walker and taxi driver.

Faster and faster I peeled through them until one of the pages tore off and twirled off down the hill in troubled elegance.\\r\\n\"Shit!\" I yelled, trying to snatch it before it broke away from my grasp. My frustration gathered and I opened to a new page in my notebook.</em>\\r\\nElliot Kole was always listening to the blues, the old stuff, before the covers and the cheap imitations, Clapton being an exception. He used to play along to it on his guitar for hours at a time until one of his strings snapped from playing too aggressively.\\r\\n<em>Wait. no. stop.I ripped the page out completely and started over.</em>\\r\\nWe arrived at the hardware store with no traffic on the way, no bombs, or sudden changes in gravity. My dad and I walked through each hallway looking for tools for his shop. He was planning on building the Ark when the great storm hit. It would come in a couple days over the Rocky Mountains and wash away the entire human race, all because of global warming. Wow, how great is that?\\r\\n\"Can I help you?\" One of the store employees asked.\\r\\nMy dad looked over at the man like he was looking at a ghost. He shook his head and walked on down the hall silently.\\r\\n\"We''re fine,\" I replied. The man shrugged and walked away. My father was a bit depressed about the future, so he spoke little. He was focused only on getting the right tools, the tools to build the Ark to save our family and maybe thousands of other people from a perilous death. Suddenly, there was a huge explosion that crashed out from above us.\\r\\nWait. what was that? My eyes opened up to darkness, pure darkness. I squinted as rain drops dripped down across my eyelashes and through my clothing. The notebooks in my left hand were somewhat scattered out near the tips of my fingers as if I had suddenly fallen asleep and pushed them aside.\\r\\nThen there was a terrifying flash of lightning that lit up the sky for a brief second. Thunder followed it almost immediately, crackling and echoing out into the expanse like the snapping of burning wood over a large fire. I froze completely, paralyzed in the soaking wet grass that attempted to drown me as it became wetter and wetter. I leaned forward with my notebooks in my hand and looked out onto the other hills in shock. Each hill had become its own island, mine being the largest. I tried to find the remains of Fairview below the depths of the Western sea and saw nothing more than the reflection of black ink sky.\\r\\nOff in the distance I saw an enormous, wooden ship. I stood up and started waving furiously to catch its attention over the thickening fog. It didn''t take long for it to reach me and when it did, I was amazed to find that it was my father leading it.\\r\\n\"Take that ladder!\" He yelled.\\r\\nI grabbed the rope ladder hanging off the side of the boat and slowly climbed onboard. I kept my head leveled to the ground as waterfalls of water lashed out past my face.\\r\\n\"A-are we going to die?!\" I shouted over the storm.\\r\\n\"I don''t know!\" Was his reply, which was barely audible as the lions roared out through the heavens.\\r\\nI shuddered as more lightning scattered through the air. I worried about it striking the boat. I worried about it taking my life. Frying every organ in my body and blowing pieces of my brains all over the place. I''d lay down, lifeless, with smoke dissolving off of my charred body.\\r\\nI looked over at my father with his buckets, scooping out water that flooded the boat constantly. I felt like helping him but I didn''t know what to do. I didn''t know anything at the moment, I was terrified and confused. I looked around the boat at groups of other people, huddled up against the walls of the boat, petrified.\\r\\nAnd unexpectedly, everything began to smear. I watched in terror as huge tsunamis cornered us at every direction. I watched as the boat literally melted onto the sea and evaporated into the air. The fingers on my hands began to disintigrate in every way without discharging any pain. I tried to scream but my face curled into a misshapen ball. I could hear everyone around me screaming as their bodies fused together. I could''ve sworn that I had just died at that moment as an awkward silence sounded out around me, followed by the soft sound of spring wind. I could see only white, I could feel nothing, and do absolutely nothing. I could only listen to the strange sounds that seemed to secrete around me.\\r\\n<em>Ah! I''m doing it again! No more \"I\"''s! No more \"I\"''s I erased everything I had written and heaved a huge sigh of irritation. And I''m still doing it! There''s no stopping it! I stood up with the notebooks in my hands and stepped down the hill furiously. I decided to stop there and go home. Home was about four miles from here. It would probably take thirty minutes to walk there.\\r\\nOnce I had cleared the hills I peered down across the highway which sat peacefully as cars drove across it this way and that. The lane coming towards me was crowded with traffic that had come to a complete stop. People honked and tried to drive down the side of the road but ended up getting caught by the cops halfway across.\\r\\nI looked up into the sky at a large ball of light surging towards them at great speeds while cars began to lift off from the ground and float off through the sky, vanishing over mountains and crashing into small towns. The Rocky Mountains erupted with lava that flooded the cities around them. The skies slowly grew darker and darker till everything became pitch black and I could see nothing, feel nothing, and do absolutely nothing. The creases and folds would come next, and I would be ready, as long as it wasn''t lightning, I would be ready. </em>', 'Creases and Folds by Scott Jensen', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', '16-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-08-12 12:27:14', '2016-08-12 20:27:14', '', 16, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/16-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

He was standing on the first tee taking practice swings. Larry skidded our cart to a stop near the ball washer.\n\n\"Your wife went nuts in the sack, Tom?\" asked Larry, sitting in the golf cart filling out the names on the scorecard.\n\n\"I''ve got an idea,\" I said. I stepped out of the cart drew my driver out of my bag. \"No one can talk bullshit ''til we get to the fourth hole.\"\n\n\"Who made you the boss, Jack Riley?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Where''s EdBob?\" asked Larry.\n\n\"He''s always late,\" I said.\n\n\"You wouldn''t believe her nipples,\" said Tom, as he took more practice swings. \"And what does my wife have to do with it?\"\n\n\"I thought you said you got crazy pussy,\" Larry answered.\n\n\"I think I see EdBob coming,\" I said. \"Is that his cart?\" I was straining to look out on the course at the cart path that led to the first tee.\n\nTom looked up. \"That''s him. My wife''s out of town, Larry.\"\n\nWhen EdBob arrived at the tee, the first thing he said was, \"She made me sleep in the garage again last night.\"\n\n\"Who was it, Tom?\" asked Larry.\n\n\"Slept in the fucking garage again,\" EdBob repeated, as he stepped out of his blue and white golf cart. \"They said it might thundershower.\"\n\n\"I told you not to marry her,\" said Tom.\n\n\"What game are we playing?\" I asked, walking onto the tee box and swinging my driver and two other clubs.\n\n\"Let''s play Left-Right,\" suggested Larry.\n\n\"How is the gay life treating you, Larry,\" said Tom. \"Left and Right is for homos.\"\n\n\"We always play Wolf,\" said EdBob. \"What''s wrong with Wolf?\"\n\n\"Maybe that''s why Larry wants to play Left-Right,\" I said. \"Change is good. We''re in a Wolf rut.\"\n\n\"I think we should play Partners,\" said Tom. \"Change teams every six holes. Her nipples. Wow.\"\n\n\"Who was it, Tom?\" asked Larry. \"Anyone I know? How come you say I''m queer all the time?\"\n\nEdBob said, \"I have two or three drinks, and she tells me I''m drunk and can''t be in the house with her son, the idiot boy.\"\n\n\"You''ve never had just three drinks, EdBob,\" said Tom. \"Why did you marry her, anyhow? Isn''t Cindy number three?\"\n\n\"He likes being married,\" I said. \"Leave him alone.\" I teed up my ball. \"I''m teeing off before my clothes go out of style.\"\n\n\"Too late,\" said EdBob, and then laughed out loud at his own joke.\n\nI swung and hooked the ball severely. It rolled to a stop just before going into the pond that bordered the left side of the fairway. \"Nothing wrong with that,\" I said.\n\nLarry teed up next. \"I''m going to focus on my golf today. I''ve worked out a lot of things in practice this week. Could we have quiet on the tee box?\"\n\n\"I call bullshit on practicing,\" said EdBob, as he cleaned the face of his driver with a wooden tee. \"Just because you''re retired doesn''t mean you can practice.\"\n\n\"Jack''s retired, too,\" said Larry.\n\n\"Yea, but I don''t practice,\" I said. \"I wouldn''t be that chickenshit.\"\n\n\"When this fog burns off, it''s going to get hotter than a sumbitch,\" said Tom.\n\nLarry sliced his ball right, over a line of trees and onto the eighteenth fairway.\n\n\"All that practice fucked you up,\" I said. \"This isn''t fog. It''s clouds.\"\n\n\"I''m in transition, Jack,\" Larry explained. \"May take some time.\"\n\nTom''s drive was long and down the middle, as usual. \"You guys would play better golf if you got some strange pussy once in a while,\" Tom surmised.\n\n\"It''s actually bad for you,\" I said. \"Takes away the legs.\"\n\n\"Who was it, Tom,\" asked Larry, again. \"I haven''t had pussy for a long time. Maybe my pussy days are over.\"\n\nBack in Larry''s cart, driving down the cart path in search of balls, I said, \"Larry, you''ve got two women and no pussy. There''s something wrong with that.\"\n\n\"That''s a secret, you know.\"\n\n\"I''ve been keeping that secret for almost thirty years. I think I know it''s a secret, Larry.\"\n\n\"In fifth grade the kids used to call me ''Larry the fairy.'' I didn''t know what a fairy was back then.\"\n\nWhen we were younger men, Larry was my college roommate for three years. We even went to high school together, but we didn''t spend any time together back then. I was a jock, and he was the smartest guy at Saint Joe''s High School for Boys. Our social circles excluded one another. Even at Saint Ambrose College for Men in Northern California, Larry excluded me. He taped a strip of masking tape down the middle of our room and ordered me to stay on my side. He was very neat and studious, and I was a sloppy pig, a student of marginal ability and motivation. I should have gone to Viet Nam, but I didn''t.\n\nLater in our lives we experienced success, each in our own way. He became a successful and profitable sports psychologists, teaching at San Diego State and writing books - The Psychology of Tennis, The Psychology of Skiing, The Psychology of Golf - Same book over and over again, but they sold like crazy. I taught high school English and coached football. We are still both married to our first wives, but Larry has a complication. Thirty years ago his wife got knocked up by one of his graduate school classmates, and twenty-eight years ago, Larry knocked up his married graduate assistant, a girl who put herself through college dancing at a topless bar. The resulting daughter is now a college graduate, courtesy of Larry, and a college P.E teacher and soccer coach. The \"other women\" also profited from Larry''s generosity. After she divorced her husband six years ago, she now lives in an up-scale, three bedroom condo, courtesy of Larry.\n\n\"But, you ought to be getting pussy, Larry,\" I said, \"from someone.\"\n\nOn the first green Tom rolled in an eighteen foot put for a bogie.\n\n\"Way to go, partner,\" said EdBob, giving Tom a high five. \"Can''t win ''em all if you don''t win the first one.\"\n\n\"That''s a good thought, EdBob,\" I said, \"but Tom''s not your partner. \"We''re playing Left and Right like Larry said. Tom is my partner.\"\n\n\"I thought we were playing Partners,\" said Tom.\n\n\"What''s wrong with Wolf,\" said EdBob.\n\nHOLE # 2, PAR 3, 139 YARDS, HANDICAP #17, NOTE: SAND LEFT AND RIGHT. ..\n\n\"If I ever walk like those guys, I give you permission to shoot me,\" said Tom, as we all waited on the tee for the foursome in front of us to clear the green. \"They shouldn''t let those old fuckers out here on Saturday mornings.\"\n\n\"We''re all going to be old fuckers some day,\" I said.\n\n\"Someday?\" questioned EdBob. \"You and Larry are already there.\" He laughed again at his own joke.\n\n\"At least you two don''t walk like old fuckers,\" said Tom, nodding toward the second green where the old guys were finishing up their putting.\n\n\"We''re all afraid of getting old, Tom,\" said Larry. \"No one wants to walk like an old guy. That''s why Jack walks so fast all the time.\"\n\n\"They''re walking off,\" I said. \"If you guys would shut up for a minute, I''d like to tee off.\" I hit a seven iron just through the left sand trap onto the back fringe. \"Easy up and down,\" I said. \"What do you mean, ''That''s why Jack walks so fast''?\"\n\n\"You want to look young, Jack,\" said Larry, as he teed up his ball.\n\n\"Could maybe we stop all the psychological bullshit?\" said EdBob. \"Could maybe we just play a little golf?\"\n\nLarry''s shot was down the middle, but ten yards short of the green.\n\nBack in the cart I asked Larry again, \"What do you mean about the way I walk?\"\n\n\"The older you get the faster you walk,\" he answered. \"What are you running away from?\"\n\nFact is I''ve walked fast since I was in high school. There, I did everything I could to avoid going to classes. My best scam was to get elected or appointed to some nothing Student Body position - Assistant to the Athletic Director, Sophomore Class Vice President - and then always carry a clip board and WALK FAST. When a priest would inquire as to why I wasn''t in class, I would quicken my pace, wave my clip board at him, and say, \"Student Body business, Father.\" Worked every single time, and the fast walk habit stuck with me.\n\n\"So, Larry, I really want to know, why do you have two women and no pussy?\"\n\n\"You know all about that. You know everything,\" he answered.\n\n\"You ever take your wife anywhere? You never say anything about that?\"\n\n\"Not for the past thirty years. That''s why I can still be a Catholic. I''m faithful to only one woman.\" Silence for too long. \"Okay,\" he continued. \"I know...my life is pretty fucked up.\"\n\nOn the green EdBob putted a twelve foot putt that went fifteen feet past the hole.\n\nYou''re stabbing at the ball, EdBob,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Don''t coach, Tom,\" said EdBob. \"If I wanted lessons, I''d go to the pro shop.\"\n\n\"Just trying to help,\" said Tom. \"I think they got two inches tall.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Larry.\n\n\"Her nipples,\" answered Tom. \"Isn''t that what we were talking about?\"\n\nHole #3, Par 4, HANDICAP #15, NOTE: DOGLEG RIGHT/WATER LEFT. .\n\n\"So, you going to tell me who it was last night, Tom?\" asked Larry , still sitting in his cart writing down scores from the second hole.\n\n\"Mary Stoop,\" answered Tom, as he used the ball washer.\n\n\"Blonde? About forty something?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Tom.\n\n\"God,\" shouted Larry, suddenly abandoning his scorekeeping duties. \"She was a patient of mine. When I cleaned her teeth, she always wore a slinky blouse and no bra. She was married back then.\"\n\n\"Yeah, she talked about you. Said you always tried to look down her blouse. She''s still married,\" said Tom. \"She doesn''t own one. A bra, I mean. She says her breasts have to breathe.\"\n\n\"Republican, right wing bitch,\" I said, nodding toward the house next to the third tee box, and thinking of Toni, the woman who lived inside.\n\n\"Why don''t you let it go, Jack,\" said EdBob. \"Every time you get here, your game goes to hell for two or three holes.\"\n\nTwo or three months earlier I had gotten into a screaming match in the 19th Hole Lounge with Toni. I knew she had voted for Bush, and I made the mistake of asking her what she thought about Bush''s war we were losing.\n\n\"We need to stay the course,\" she said.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked her. \"And what course?\"\n\n\"It''s better to fight them over there than over here,\" she said between sips of iced tea. She was so right-wing, she didn''t even drink regular booze.\n\n\"Toni,\" I said, \"I''m trying to be calm, here. One easy question - Why did we invade Iraq?\"\n\n\"Helloooo,\" she said. \"Did you forget about Nine-Eleven? Did you forget they were building a newclear bomb to drop on us? Did you forget they were getting ready to send model airplanes to spray us with poison? Did you forget their, so called, god, Buddha, tells them to kill us all? Did you forget they were training Muslim terrorists?\"\n\n\"Helloooo,\" I answered. \"Iraq had nothing to do with Nine-Eleven. There were no weapons. Iraqis don''t believe in Buddha. Saddam was killing all the Muslim terrorists. There were no model airplanes. Everyone who can read knows this now, Toni. No wonder Bush won the election. Idiots like you, who don''t know their ass from a manhole cover, voted for him. There must be a lot of you retarded bitches out there.\"\n\nHer husband, a retired San Diego policeman, then beat the shit out of me, and Lisa, the bartender, banned me from the bar for a month\n.\n\n\"Let it go,\" EdBob said again. \"You''re going to screw up your round.\" But, it was too late. I hit my tee shot out of bounds to the right, into a guy''s back yard.\n\n\"Lot of anger in that swing,\" said Tom. \"When you cleaned her teeth, did you see her nipples, Larry? Why didn''t you drug her up? You could have looked all you wanted?\"\n\n\"You''re one, sick fucker,\" said EdBob, after hitting his first good tee shot down the left side of the fairway.\n\n\"At least I''m not sleeping in my garage,\" countered Tom. Moments later, after hitting his first bad drive of the day - high and short - Tom said, \"Sorry I said that, Partner. That was chickenshit.\n\"\n\n\"You''re right, Tom,\" said EdBob. \"That was chickenshit. I may have to tell Jack to kick your fat ass.\"\n\nI didn''t laugh, but the three others almost fell down laughing. I knew they were remembering the ass whipping I took in the bar.\n\n\"That''s not funny,\" I said, touching the small bump that remained under my left eye.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Tom, gasping for breath, tears streaming down his cheeks. \"We weren''t laughing at..\"\n\nHe couldn''t finish. He was laughing too hard.\n\nAt the green, EdBob''s ball was in the fringe, and he chipped it in for a par. \"I did that for you, Partner,\" he said, pointing at me.\n\n\"Jack''s not your partner, EdBob,\" said Larry. \"We''re playing Left/Right. Remember?\"\n\n\"I thought it was Partners,\" said Tom\n\nHole #4, PAR 5, 486 YARDS, #7 HANDICAP, NOTE: NOTE: TREES AND HOUSES ON RIGHT/ UP HILL LAST 50 YARDS.\n\n\"So, everyone is clear on the game we''re playing?\" said Larry, as he looked down the fourth fairway.\n\n\"All clear,\" said Tom. \"So, why don''t you divorce the bitch, EdBob?\"\n\n\"You don''t call a guy''s wife a bitch,\" I said, checking my scorecard. I was three over par after three holes. I was hoping for better after all the secret practicing I did during the week.\n\n\"He calls her bitch all the time,\" said Tom.\n\n\"That doesn''t mean you can,\" I said. \"It''s like calling a black guy a nigger. If a black guy does it, it''s okay, but not you.\"\n\n\"I agree with EdBob,\" said Tom. \"We need to stop all the philosophy bullshit. I was just wondering why EdBob won''t get a divorce. You don''t have to analyze everything all the time, Jack.\"\n\nLarry said, \"What did you get on the last hole, EdBob.\"\n\n\"Par,\" said EdBob.\n\n\"Really?\" said Tom.\n\n\"You questioning my integrity?\" asked EdBob. \"You think I''m cheating at golf?\"\n\nThe code of golfers, even weekend hackers like us: You can cheat on your taxes, you can cheat on your wife, but, you never, never, never cheat at golf. All the guys with whom I played followed the code, no matter how they cheated off the golf course. Maybe if we never left the course, we''d all be eligible for heaven.\n\n\"Sorrreeeee,\" said Tom. \"I was just asking.\"\n\n\"Well, don''t ask,\" muttered EdBob.\n\nEdBob didn''t speak to anyone until we reached the fourth green. Then his words were mechanical: \"You want the flag out? Is my mark okay?\"\n\nA month or so earlier, Tom and EdBob almost got into an actual fistfight on the ninth tee. Tom''s false teeth stopped the fight before it began. He said he had to take them out before he could whip EdBob''s ass.\n\n\"If you have to take out your teeth before fighting, Tom,\" I said, \"maybe it''s a sign.\"\n\n\"If you''re saying I''m too old, I''m not. I still get a lot of pussy, man. And, I can whip EdBob''s ass on my worst day. I was in the Golden Gloves.\"\n\nLooking at Tom''s plumb, squatty body, Larry and I were struck with the contrast between our vision and his words, and could not contain our laughter. It was contagious, and the bomb was diffused. Even Tom laughed, just not as much as we did.\n\nI putted in from four feet for a bogie (another bogie). \"What''s the game score?\" I asked Larry.\n\n\"I think we''re all square. No blood.\"\n\n\"Bullshit,\" said Tom. \"EdBob parred the last hole. Didn''t that put us ahead?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Larry. \"Jack and I had strokes.\"\n\n\"Oh, that''s right,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Are you questioning my integrity?\" asked Larry, mocking EdBob, making an effort at humor. No one laughed.\n\nHole #5, 404 YARDS, PAR 4, #1 HANDICAP. NOTE: NEED A LONG DRIVE.\n\nI told myself to swing easy - hit hard, but it didn''t work. At the top of my takeaway, I had the thought that that I could get my first 250 yard drive if I gave it just a little extra. I topped the ball. It dribbled forward just past the women''s tee.\n\n\"At least you don''t have to take your dick out,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Real Man Rules,\" stated that if you did not drive your ball past the women''s tee, you had to hang your wanger out for the rest of the round to show that you were not a woman.\n\nI was angry. At myself. \"At least if I hung it, it would be visible,\" I said to Tom.\n\n\"You want to play ''Whip It Out'' right now?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Whip It Out\" was an old grammar school game in which seventh grade boys compared their manhood with their peers.\n\n\"Jesus, Tom,\" said Larry. \"Grow up, man.\"\n\n\"First you tell me I''m old, then you tell me to grow up. What the fuck.\"\n\n\"I didn''t say you were too old, Tom,\" said Larry.\"\n\n\"Jack did. He said I had a little dick.\"\n\n\"Could we maybe get some golf in between all this bullshit?\" asked EdBob, just before he made his second good drive in a row.\n\nBack in the cart, Larry asked me why no one ever laughed at anything he said. I got the idea it bothered him.\n\n\"I don''t know,\" I said. \"I still want to know why you take care of two women and get no pussy.\"\n\n\"Jack, we''re almost sixty-five. Guy''s sixty-five don''t have sex. And, Rachel''s almost as old as I am. Remember when we were young guys? We thought old people screwing was really sick.\n\n\"That''s because we were young and dumb.\"\n\n\"I still think like that. How come EdBob got so quiet?\"\n\n\"You don''t have to tell old women what to do. They have all that experience. They know everything.\" I said. \"EdBob''s afraid of being alone, like all the rest of us.\"\n\nI''ve known EdBob for almost twenty years. His history with women has been rocky. wife, Carol, a counselor at the high school where EdBob teaches. I liked Carol, kind of. I wouldn''t have chosen her as a wife, but I thought she was okay for EdBob. She left EdBob because of EdBob. EdBob drinks. Carol told my wife that EdBob wasn''t a husband at all during their last few years of marriage. He drank and went out to his workshop where he made fishing lures.\n\nThe woman he is now married to (her name is Cindy) is a complete nut ball. Everything I know is second hand. She''s got one of those disorders that make her go crazy when she has even a drop of alcohol. She''s done violent things to EdBob. He has bite marks all over him. She beat on his golf cart with a seven iron. She smashed his car windshield with a hammer. I''ve seen all the damage, but I get only EdBob''s side of the story. Maybe Cindy has a story too, but I''ll never know.\n\nHole #6, 329 YARDS, PAR 4, HANDICAP #9. NOTE: BLIND TEE SHOT UP HILL. OUR OF BOUNDS AND SAND TRAP RIGHT, FOREST OF OAKS ON LEFT. I HATE THIS HOLE.\n\n\"I hate this hole,\" said EdBob, as he stopped his cart next to the tee.\n\n\"You''ve got to love it, EdBob,\" I said. \"As long as you have to play it, you might as well love it.\"\n\n\"Shut up, Jack,\" said Tom. \"I''ll bet you''ve never had bad sex.\"\n\n\"The worst sex I''ve ever had was sensational,\" I answered.\n\n\"I''m hitting,\" said Larry, teeing up his ball. \"It''s pretty hard for me to concentrate with all this bullshit going on all the time.\"\n\n\"It''s only golf, Larry,\" I said.\n\n\"Golf is the most fun thing in my life,\" said Larry.\n\n\"You like golf better than pussy?\" asked EdBob.\n\n\"Shut up, EdBob,\" said Larry, before hitting his shot into the oaks on the left.\n\n\"At least you''re not out of bounds,\" I said.\n\n\"Shut up, Jack,\" said Larry.\n\nI hit a good one, right down the middle to the top of the hill. \"Perfect,\" I said.\n\n\"You think every shot you hit is perfect,\" said Tom.\n\nSometimes I make myself sick. Tom was right. I tend to look for the silver lining. Find it even when it is not there. Maybe I''ve always been that way, or maybe I learned that as a high school football coach for forty years. During the bad years, when my teams were losing more than winning, I had to keep the kids hopeful. I had to come up with new goals and forget the old ones. I had to say things to them like, \"We''re going to play this last game for pride,\" and \"The next game is the only one that counts.\" Okay, it was kind of bullshit, but why make things worse than they have to be?\n\nTom had a bad sixth hole. He hit his tee shot out of bounds and then hit his second tee shot out of bounds. Then he said, \"Fuck it. I don''t give a shit,\" before stomping back to EdBob''s cart, sitting down in the passenger seat, folding his arms across his chest, and pouting. \"I''m out of the hole,\" he muttered.\n\n\"Jesus, Tom. It''s only golf, man,\" I said\n\n\"Yeah,\" said EdBob.\n\nTom said, \"Why do you let her treat you that way?\"\n\n\"He likes being treated that way,\" I said. \"Leave him alone.\"\n\n\"Why do you think you always have all the answers, Jack?\" said Tom, still pouting in the cart.\n\n\"Okay, I''ll shut up,\" I said, vowing to say nothing else for the rest of the round.\n\nLarry, driving me up the hill to where my ball lay, said, \"Hope I can find my ball. I wonder why Tom is so pissed.\"\n\n\"You''ll find it,\" I said, hoping I would not have to help him look. I hated looking for missing balls unless they were mine. I am selfish that way. \"Tom''s pissed because he''s Tom. After his next good shot, he''ll be fine. He doesn''t get all the women he says he gets.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"If he did, he wouldn''t talk about it all the time.\"\n\nEven though Tom was out of the hole, it took a long time for us to complete number six. We looked for Larry''s ball for more than five minutes, which is the limit according to golf rules, but no one called a penalty. When we finally found it, Larry had no shot, but he tried anyhow and ended up with a triple bogie.\n\n\"All that practice,\" said Larry, scowling and writing down his score.\n\nHole #7, Par 4, 372 yards, #11 handicap. Notes: flat, not much trouble right or left. Almost boring.\n\nTom teed off on number seven even before we were off the number six green. \"We need to pick up the pace,\" he called, after hitting a good shot. He was looking at the foursome behind us who were standing on the top of the hill, looking down at the green. They all had their hands on their hips - the universal golf sign for \"Get a move on.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said Larry. \"I lost a ball. Am I the only golfer to ever have to look for a ball?\"\n\n\"It''s time to change partners,\" said Tom.\n\n\"We''re not playing partners,\" I said. \"We''re playing Left and Right.\"\n\n\"I thought we were playing Wolf,\" said EdBob.\n\n\"I''m keeping score for Left and Right,\" said Larry, \"but anything is okay with me.\" He drove his ball down the right side into the rough.\n\n\"You and Jack were partners for the first six holes,\" said Tom. \"Now I''ll toss a tee to see who my partner is now.\" Tom tossed the tee. It pointed at Larry.\n\nI took my bag off of Larry''s cart and strapped it onto EdBob''s. EdBob drove his ball left into the fairway bunker.\n\n\"Who won the first six holes?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don''t know,\" said Larry. \"I''ll have to figure that out. I was keeping score for Left and Right.\"\n\nI popped my ball up. Very short, but down the middle.\n\nTom loaded his bag onto Larry''s cart and hopped in the passenger seat. \"How can anyone play with EdBob?\" he asked Larry, loud enough for EdBob to hear. \"I feel an ass kickin'' coming on now that I have a real partner.\"\n\n\"We''ll see about that,\" I said. \"EdBob and I are the A Team.\"\n\n\"A for assholes,\" said Tom, laughing, as Larry sped away.\n\n\"Don''t let Tom get back into my cart,\" said EdBob, as he drove me to my ball.\n\n\"How come?\" I asked.\n\n\"He gives advice. He tells me to divorce Cindy, just because she beats up my cart and my car and bites me all over. She''s getting better, Jack. Swear to God.\"\n\n\"I don''t give advice, EdBob.\"\n\n\"I know. That''s why I like you riding in my cart. Jack, if you wanted to give me advice, what would you tell me about Cindy?\"\n\n\"I don''t even know Cindy. I don''t know your wife, EdBob.\"\n\n\"She''s a real bitch, Jack.\"\n\n\"Well, I''ve heard she''s done some evil things to you.\"\n\n\"She told me she was going to come on the golf course and fuck up our round today.\"\n\n\"No way.\"\n\n\"Way,\" said EdBob.\n\n\"Well, let''s not worry about it right now. Let''s just focus on golf.\"\n\n\"That''s what we''re here for, right?\"\n\nEdBob''s second shot went way off line to the right, into the street where it struck a passing UPS truck, rocketed back toward the green, and stopped in the short fringe just ten feet from the flag stick.\n\n\"I call major bullshit on that,\" said Tom. \"There''s got to be a rule about that. Your ball was out of bounds, EdBob.\"\n\n\"Was, is the key word, Tom,\" I said, defending my partner.\n\n\"It hit a moving vehicle. I''m checking this out when we make the turn.\"\n\n\"I know it''s okay, Tom,\" said Larry. \"It''s the same as if it hit a house out of bounds.\"\n\n\"Houses don''t speed down the fucking road at sixty miles an hour, for christsakes,\" said Tom. \"This is major bullshit.\"\n\n\"I think it''s bullshit too,\" said Larry, \"but I think it''s minor. Let''s just keep playing, Tom.\"\n\nAt the green EdBob putted his ball to within six inches, turned to Tom and said, \"That good?\"\n\nTom would normally \"give\" a putt that short, but now he said, \"Mark it or putt it.\"\n\n\"Fuck you, Tom,\" said EdBob, before tapping in his putt. He then turned to me and said \"We''ve been partners for one hole, and we''re already ahead by one.\" He then laughed. Tom''s putt ended about two feet from the hole. \"Mark it or putt it,\" said EdBob.\n\n\"It''s for a five,\" said Tom. \"It doesn''t matter.\"\n\n\"Mark it or putt it,\" EdBob repeated.\n\n\"Can''t we all just get along,\" said Larry.\n\nAfter missing his short putt, Tom said, \"I''ll never be able to get along with that penis head.\"\n\nHole #8, PAR 3, 178 YARDS, #13 HANDICAP. NOTE: SANDTRAPS LEFT AND RIGHT AND BACK.\n\nNo one hit the eighth green, the way the good golfers do. I was in the sand trap on the right. EdBob was down the middle but fifty yards short.\n\n\"One up, one in, and you''ve got your par, EdBob,\" I said to my partner.\n\n\"With my luck, I''ll probably hit in the sand trap,\" said EdBob. EdBob''s next shot went into the sand trap on the left. \"See what I mean?\"\n\n\"Well, if you have those negative thoughts, it screws up your swing.\"\n\n\"Wouldn''t you have negative thoughts if you had Cindy for a wife? What if you had to sleep in the garage? Wouldn''t you be a little negative?\"\n\nEdBob drove me to the green. \"I should probably divorce her,\" he said to me. \"What do you think?\"\n\n\"I don''t know,\" I said, looking at my ball in the sand trap and thinking about my shot. \"I don''t even know her, EdBob.\"\n\n\"You know she''s a bitch. I told you what a bitch she is.\"\n\nWhen I was over my ball, EdBob shut up. I hit the shot to thin. It skidded across the green and into the sand trap on the opposite side.\n\n\"At least you don''t have to change clubs,\" said Tom. He turned to Larry, hoping Larry was laughing. He wasn''t.\n\nLarry said, \"He probably feels bad enough.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jesus,\" said Tom. \"What are we doing here, playing the U.S. fucking Open? It''s only golf, for christsakes.\"\n\nTom chipped his ball to within six inches. I said, \"That''s good, Tom.\" Tom picked up the ball.\n\n\"I didn''t give you that putt,\" said EdBob.\n\n\"Your partner gave it to me,\" said Tom.\n\nLarry putted from off the green and went way past the hole.\n\n\"But I didn''t give it to you. Both guys on the opponent''s team have to give it to you.\"\n\n\"I gave him the putt, EdBob,\" I said. \"Shut up and let me hit my ball.\" I made a better sand shot this time but still had to putt twice and took a double bogie.\n\nEdBob also ended with a double bogie.\n\n\"Good ass whipping,\" Tom said to Larry, as the two walked off the green. \"We''re tied. I knew I''d start playing better when I got a partner who wasn''t a fuck face.\"\n\nWhen we got back to EdBob''s cart, all four tires were flat\n.\n\n\"All your tires are flat, EdBob,\" said Larry.\n\n\"The bitch,\" shouted EdBob. \"She told me she was going to foul up our round.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do about it, EdBob?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Maybe it wasn''t her,\" said EdBob.\n\n\"It was her, EdBob,\" said Larry, pulling an ice pick from the back tire. \"She left the ice pick in the back tire. Who else?\"\n\n\"That does it for me. I''m going to have to confront her on this one.\"\n\nLarry called the pro shop on his cell phone. Jason, one of the assistant pros, came out with a cart for EdBob and me, and the marshal, Dave, said he could fix the ice pick damage. He towed EdBob''s cart and Jason back to the cart barn.\n\nHole #9, PAR 4, 375 YARDS, #5 HANDICAP. NOTE: SECOND SHOT OVER A STREAM, SAND TRAPS ALL AROUND THE GREEN. .\n\nTom and I hit our tee shots close to one another. EdBob dropped me off at my ball and took off in search of his, which he had pulled to the left. So, Tom and I were standing by our respective balls waiting for the old gentlemen to clear the green.\n\n\"Marilyn Stoop knows you, Jack,\" said Tom. \"She told me last night.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" I said. \"I know Marilyn Stoop. I coached her kid. Look at those thunderheads. I think they''re coming our way.\" Why can''t women keep their mouths shut about their excursions off the reservation? It was just one afternoon. Not even the night. And, that was five or six years ago.\n\nEveryone thought I was a saint because I never talked about sex very much. In an almost imperceptible way, I displayed disdain toward my three golf buddies because of their women problems. I was above all that.\n\nOkay, it''s hard to be perfect. My wife was on a trip with her girlfriend to Alaska, on a cruise ship, for ten days. I was lonely. I was horny. I wanted to be young again.\n\nAt three o''clock on a Monday afternoon, Marilyn Stoop and I were the only two in the 19th Hole Lounge. Lisa had already served me two beers and had served Marilyn Stoop two martinis \"in a bucket, on ice.\" I paid for her second drink.\n\nWe talked.\n\nWe went to my house.\n\nWe fucked.\n\nI asked her to stay the night, but she said she had to get home to fix dinner.\n\nThat was it. That was all there was. I''ve been a saint ever since, although I still have fantasies about those crazy, elevating nipples.\n\n\"How about those nipples?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"I''m thinking about my shot, Tom. Would you shut the fuck up?\"\n\nWe tied the hole. No blood. Match still even.\n\nAt the turn, EdBob and Tom went to the snack bar, and Larry and I went into the pro shop to check on our Tuesday tee time. The assistant pro, Leon, was behind the counter.\n\n\"You have seven twenty-two,\" he told us, before we asked. \"And, tell EdBob his wife rented a cart this morning. Charged it to EdBob. She only had it for fifteen minutes. I''m not going to charge him.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Leon,\" said Larry. \"I''ll tell him.\"\n\nHOLE #10, PAR 4, 351 YARDS, HANDICAP # 12 NOTE: THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY HOLD. WATER WAY LEFT, FAIRWAY SAN RIGHT, W"ID"E FAIRWAY.\n\nTo Tom''s credit he didn''t tell everyone about me and Marilyn Stoop, but now he knew I couldn''t say anything about him. Nothing negative. Nothing about him being a womanizer.\n\n\"How come you''re such a womanizer, Tom?\" asked EdBob, as he teed up on the tenth. \"Don''t you get good poon at home?\"\n\n\"Jesus,\" said Larry,\" is that all you guys ever talk about? Why can''t we talk about movies or books or cars once in a while?\"\n\n\"EdBob can''t read,\" explained Tom. Then he laughed.\n\n\"I read,\" said EdBob, \"if there''s something worth reading. All the books Jack gives me are bullshit.\" He looked at me. \"I don''t mean they''re bullshit for you, Jack, but for me they''re bullshit. All the Grisham books are movies. And the other stuff, like 1776, I already know we won the fucking war.\"\n\nI don''t blame EdBob. When I read something that fires me up, I want everyone else to be fired up too. It never works. I like a lot of things my golf buds don''t like, and they like a lot of things I don''t like. EdBob does the New York Times crossword puzzle every day. Tom reads the fish report every day and takes overnight trips on boats to catch albacore. Larry is into cars. He just bought a Ferrari. Cost him over one hundred thousand dollars. I like reading books. When I talk about books, when Larry talks about fast cars, when EdBob talks about his crosswords, when Tom talks about fishing, everyone ends up telling every one else to shut the fuck up and play golf. Maybe that''s why the major topic of conversation always reverts to pussy. All of us agree that pussy is a good thing. Some of us still like it. Some of us can only think back to the time when it was our religion.\n\n\"I get good poon at home,\" said Tom, before teeing off and pulling his ball way left and almost into the water. \"Why would you even ask such a dumb question, EdBob?\"\n\n\"Just wondered why you''re out chasing poontang all the time.\"\n\nBack in the cart EdBob said to me, \"Tom''s pretty fucked up, and he doesn''t know how fucked up he is.\"\n\n\"We''re all a little fucked up, EdBob,\" I said.\n\n\"I''m not,\" said EdBob. \"Not when I get things worked out with Cindy.\"\n\n\"I''d like to win this hole,\" I said. \"I like our chances. Tom''s in trouble over there by the water. I think I felt a rain drop.\n\"\n\nEdBob''s second shot was ugly. It never got off the ground, but it rolled and rolled and stopped just off the front of the green. \"I like it,\" said EdBob. \"Easy par from there.\"\n\nMy second shot was a good one. It landed on the green and rolled about fifteen feet past the hole. I would have a downhill putt for birdie.\n\nLarry shanked his second far right and almost out of bounds. \"Fuck me blue,\" he shouted, as he slammed his six iron into the turf. \"I hit these great in practice.\"\n\nTom hit into the water and started pouting again.\n\nEdBob and I won the hole to go one up.\n\nHOLE #11, PAR 5, 496 YARDS, #2 HANDICAP, NOTE: HIT SECOND SHOT OVER WATER, OR PLAY IT SAFE AND LAY UP.\n\n\"These teams aren''t fair,\" I said to EdBob. \"Too easy for us.\" I made sure I spoke loudly enough for Tom and Larry to hear.\n\nTom stopped pouting and became aggressive.\n\n\"I''m getting a little tired of your ''I''m above it all'' attitude, Jack,\" said Tom, glaring at me. \"I know you''re not perfect, if you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"What does he mean?\" asked Larry, as he followed us to the tee.\n\n\"Ask Tom,\" I said. \"Tom knows everything.\" Larry didn''t ask, at least not right then.\n\nBack in the cart, after all of us hit acceptable tee shots, EdBob asked me, \"What did Tom mean?\"\n\n\"I never know what Tom means. I agree with you; Tom''s fucked up.\"\n\nAnd that''s true. I knew he was a mess the day I met him nine or ten years ago. He and I were just a twosome late on a weekday afternoon. We were standing on the same eleventh tee. Suddenly, Tom ran off the tee and hid behind an oleander bush. He stayed there for two or three minutes. When he returned, he teed off, got back into the cart, and said nothing. Because I had just met him, I didn''t inquire as to his behavior, but I was thinking, This guy is pretty fucked up.\n\nFinally, he said, \"You probably think I''m pretty fucked up. But, my wife can''t see me here. I think I saw her car coming up the road.\"\n\n\"Why can''t she see you?\" I asked\n\n\"Because I can never lie to her. I told her I would never lie to her again. I told her that in front of the counselor. So, shit.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. And that''s as far as that conversation got.\n\nSince then, I''ve gotten to know a lot about Tom, because Tom tells everything. Tom makes a lot of money selling insulation to big housing contractors. When in college he was on the USC golf team. He''s got a love hate thing going with his wife. She looks Asian to me. He and his wife go to marriage counselors. Four or five years ago he fell in love with a girl he met at a sales convention. His wife found out and left him. He was devastated. When he had her name tattooed on his ass, she returned. They are still together, but they still go to a marriage counselor.\n\nAs we reached the eleventh green, large, dark clouds gathered over us, and the wind blew off EdBob''s hat and took it fifty yards up the fairway. We were all able to blame our missed putts on the weather. \"Tiger Woods couldn''t putt in this wind,\" said Tom, when he missed his putt.\n\nHOLE #12, PAR 3, 130 YARDS, #18 HANDICAP (easiest hole on the course), NOTE: TEE SHOT ACROSS WATER.\n\nThe rain became serious as the four of us approached the twelfth tee.\n\n\"A little rain never hurt anyone,\" said Larry. \"Rain is like part of nature. We''re meant to thrive in rain.\"\n\n\"Jesus,\" said EdBob. He was putting on his rain gear he carried in his golf bag. \"Could we give the touchy feely bullshit a little break?\"\n\nThen we saw the first lightning, and moments later heard a horrendous thunder clap.\n\n\"I''m getting the fuck out of here,\" said Tom, moving off the tee and toward his cart.\n\n\"These things usually last just a few minutes, Tom.\" I said. \"Let''s wait a while. You don''t want to quit just because you''re behind, do you, Tom?\"\n\n\"We''re not behind,\" said Tom. Another flash of lightning. The rain increased. More thunder.\n\n\"We''d better get out of here,\" said Larry. \"You know what happens if you get struck by lightning?\"\n\n\"You guys are pussies,\" said EdBob, in full rain garb, teeing up his ball. The wind blew his ball off the tee.\n\nThe next lightning struck an oak tree near the twelfth green. A large limb fell to the ground and smoke rose from the injured tree.\n\nEdBob ran to his cart without retrieving his ball that had blown to the back of the tee box. \"Tom''s right,\" he said. \"We''d better go.\"\n\nBy the time we got into the 19th Hole Lounge, all of us, except EdBob, were soaked to the skin.\n\n\"If it stops, we''re going to finish,\" I said, after sitting down at the bar and asking Lisa to pour me a brandy. Lisa was still my friend, even though she eighty-sixed me for what I said to Toni.\n\n\"I''m not going back out,\" said Tom. \"Miller Light, Lisa?\"\n\n\"Not until you say please,\" said Lisa, after putting my brandy in front of me.\n\n\"Please,\" said Tom.\n\nLarry sat to my left and EdBob to my right. Tom sat next to EdBob. I had the best seat, right over the sink. That''s where Lisa leaned over to wash glasses.\n\n\"If you don''t go back out, you forfeit the match,\" said EdBob. \"My regular, Lisa, please.\" EdBob''s regular was bourbon and diet coke.\n\n\"I''m calling bullshit on that right now,\" said Tom, before taking his first sip of beer.\n\n\"That would only be fair, Tom,\" said Larry, after ordering a ginger ale.\n\n\"You''re the only man in the whole club who drinks ginger ale,\" said Lisa.\n\n\"How is the gay life treating you, Larry?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Don''t start, Tom,\" said Larry. \"You know I''m not queer, don''t you, Lisa?\"\n\n\"I know, Larry,\" said Lisa, smiling. \"Tom just babbles.\" She leaned over to wash a glass.\n\n\"How did the matches end up, Larry?\" asked EdBob.\n\n\"Scorecard got pretty wet,\" said Larry after sipping his ginger ale. \"I think EdBob and I won the first six holes when we were playing Left and Right\" Larry was dabbing the soaked scorecard with a paper napkin.\n\n\"I didn''t think we were ever playing Left and Right,\" I said.\n\n\"We were playing Partners,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Not until the seventh hole,\" said Larry. \"I thought that was when we switched.\"\n\nEdBob said, \"Am I the only guy who can keep anything straight around here? We were playing Wolf.\"\n\n\"I''m not paying,\" said Tom, as he finished his beer. \"And, I''m going home. See you boys next Saturday,\" said Tom, patting each of us on the back before leaving.\n\n\"Talk about your poor losers,\" said EdBob, after Tom left. \"Give me another, Lisa?\"\n\n\"I''m out of here, too,\" I said, after tossing down the last of my drink. \"What''s our time for next week?\"\n\n\"He''ll call,\" said EdBob, nodding at Larry.\n\n\"I''ll call everyone,\" confirmed Larry.\n\nWhen I got the parking lot, the rain had stopped.\n', 'A Saturday Round of Golf by Michael J.

He was standing on the first tee taking practice swings. Larry skidded our cart to a stop near the ball washer.\\r\\n\"Your wife went nuts in the sack, Tom?\" asked Larry, sitting in the golf cart filling out the names on the scorecard.\\r\\n\"I''ve got an idea,\" I said. I stepped out of the cart drew my driver out of my bag. \"No one can talk bullshit ''til we get to the fourth hole.\"\\r\\n\"Who made you the boss, Jack Riley?\" asked Tom.\\r\\n\"Where''s EdBob?\" asked Larry.\\r\\n\"He''s always late,\" I said.\\r\\n\"You wouldn''t believe her nipples,\" said Tom, as he took more practice swings. \"And what does my wife have to do with it?\"\\r\\n\"I thought you said you got crazy pussy,\" Larry answered.\\r\\n\"I think I see EdBob coming,\" I said. \"Is that his cart?\" I was straining to look out on the course at the cart path that led to the first tee.\\r\\nTom looked up. \"That''s him. My wife''s out of town, Larry.\"\\r\\nWhen EdBob arrived at the tee, the first thing he said was, \"She made me sleep in the garage again last night.\"\\r\\n\"Who was it, Tom?\" asked Larry.\\r\\n\"Slept in the fucking garage again,\" EdBob repeated, as he stepped out of his blue and white golf cart. \"They said it might thundershower.\"\\r\\n\"I told you not to marry her,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"What game are we playing?\" I asked, walking onto the tee box and swinging my driver and two other clubs.\\r\\n\"Let''s play Left-Right,\" suggested Larry.\\r\\n\"How is the gay life treating you, Larry,\" said Tom. \"Left and Right is for homos.\"\\r\\n\"We always play Wolf,\" said EdBob. \"What''s wrong with Wolf?\"\\r\\n\"Maybe that''s why Larry wants to play Left-Right,\" I said. \"Change is good. We''re in a Wolf rut.\"\\r\\n\"I think we should play Partners,\" said Tom. \"Change teams every six holes. Her nipples. Wow.\"\\r\\n\"Who was it, Tom?\" asked Larry. \"Anyone I know? How come you say I''m queer all the time?\"\\r\\nEdBob said, \"I have two or three drinks, and she tells me I''m drunk and can''t be in the house with her son, the idiot boy.\"\\r\\n\"You''ve never had just three drinks, EdBob,\" said Tom. \"Why did you marry her, anyhow? Isn''t Cindy number three?\"\\r\\n\"He likes being married,\" I said. \"Leave him alone.\" I teed up my ball. \"I''m teeing off before my clothes go out of style.\"\\r\\n\"Too late,\" said EdBob, and then laughed out loud at his own joke.\\r\\nI swung and hooked the ball severely. It rolled to a stop just before going into the pond that bordered the left side of the fairway. \"Nothing wrong with that,\" I said.\\r\\nLarry teed up next. \"I''m going to focus on my golf today. I''ve worked out a lot of things in practice this week. Could we have quiet on the tee box?\"\\r\\n\"I call bullshit on practicing,\" said EdBob, as he cleaned the face of his driver with a wooden tee. \"Just because you''re retired doesn''t mean you can practice.\"\\r\\n\"Jack''s retired, too,\" said Larry.\\r\\n\"Yea, but I don''t practice,\" I said. \"I wouldn''t be that chickenshit.\"\\r\\n\"When this fog burns off, it''s going to get hotter than a sumbitch,\" said Tom.\\r\\nLarry sliced his ball right, over a line of trees and onto the eighteenth fairway.\\r\\n\"All that practice fucked you up,\" I said. \"This isn''t fog. It''s clouds.\"\\r\\n\"I''m in transition, Jack,\" Larry explained. \"May take some time.\"\\r\\nTom''s drive was long and down the middle, as usual. \"You guys would play better golf if you got some strange pussy once in a while,\" Tom surmised.\\r\\n\"It''s actually bad for you,\" I said. \"Takes away the legs.\"\\r\\n\"Who was it, Tom,\" asked Larry, again. \"I haven''t had pussy for a long time. Maybe my pussy days are over.\"\\r\\nBack in Larry''s cart, driving down the cart path in search of balls, I said, \"Larry, you''ve got two women and no pussy. There''s something wrong with that.\"\\r\\n\"That''s a secret, you know.\"\\r\\n\"I''ve been keeping that secret for almost thirty years. I think I know it''s a secret, Larry.\"\\r\\n\"In fifth grade the kids used to call me ''Larry the fairy.'' I didn''t know what a fairy was back then.\"\\r\\nWhen we were younger men, Larry was my college roommate for three years. We even went to high school together, but we didn''t spend any time together back then. I was a jock, and he was the smartest guy at Saint Joe''s High School for Boys. Our social circles excluded one another. Even at Saint Ambrose College for Men in Northern California, Larry excluded me. He taped a strip of masking tape down the middle of our room and ordered me to stay on my side. He was very neat and studious, and I was a sloppy pig, a student of marginal ability and motivation. I should have gone to Viet Nam, but I didn''t.\\r\\nLater in our lives we experienced success, each in our own way. He became a successful and profitable sports psychologists, teaching at San Diego State and writing books - The Psychology of Tennis, The Psychology of Skiing, The Psychology of Golf - Same book over and over again, but they sold like crazy. I taught high school English and coached football. We are still both married to our first wives, but Larry has a complication. Thirty years ago his wife got knocked up by one of his graduate school classmates, and twenty-eight years ago, Larry knocked up his married graduate assistant, a girl who put herself through college dancing at a topless bar. The resulting daughter is now a college graduate, courtesy of Larry, and a college P.E teacher and soccer coach. The \"other women\" also profited from Larry''s generosity. After she divorced her husband six years ago, she now lives in an up-scale, three bedroom condo, courtesy of Larry.\\r\\n\"But, you ought to be getting pussy, Larry,\" I said, \"from someone.\"\\r\\nOn the first green Tom rolled in an eighteen foot put for a bogie.\\r\\n\"Way to go, partner,\" said EdBob, giving Tom a high five. \"Can''t win ''em all if you don''t win the first one.\"\\r\\n\"That''s a good thought, EdBob,\" I said, \"but Tom''s not your partner. \"We''re playing Left and Right like Larry said. Tom is my partner.\"\\r\\n\"I thought we were playing Partners,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"What''s wrong with Wolf,\" said EdBob.\\r\\nHOLE # 2, PAR 3, 139 YARDS, HANDICAP #17, NOTE: SAND LEFT AND RIGHT. ..\\r\\n\"If I ever walk like those guys, I give you permission to shoot me,\" said Tom, as we all waited on the tee for the foursome in front of us to clear the green. \"They shouldn''t let those old fuckers out here on Saturday mornings.\"\\r\\n\"We''re all going to be old fuckers some day,\" I said.\\r\\n\"Someday?\" questioned EdBob. \"You and Larry are already there.\" He laughed again at his own joke.\\r\\n\"At least you two don''t walk like old fuckers,\" said Tom, nodding toward the second green where the old guys were finishing up their putting.\\r\\n\"We''re all afraid of getting old, Tom,\" said Larry. \"No one wants to walk like an old guy. That''s why Jack walks so fast all the time.\"\\r\\n\"They''re walking off,\" I said. \"If you guys would shut up for a minute, I''d like to tee off.\" I hit a seven iron just through the left sand trap onto the back fringe. \"Easy up and down,\" I said. \"What do you mean, ''That''s why Jack walks so fast''?\"\\r\\n\"You want to look young, Jack,\" said Larry, as he teed up his ball.\\r\\n\"Could maybe we stop all the psychological bullshit?\" said EdBob. \"Could maybe we just play a little golf?\"\\r\\nLarry''s shot was down the middle, but ten yards short of the green.\\r\\nBack in the cart I asked Larry again, \"What do you mean about the way I walk?\"\\r\\n\"The older you get the faster you walk,\" he answered. \"What are you running away from?\"\\r\\nFact is I''ve walked fast since I was in high school. There, I did everything I could to avoid going to classes. My best scam was to get elected or appointed to some nothing Student Body position - Assistant to the Athletic Director, Sophomore Class Vice President - and then always carry a clip board and WALK FAST. When a priest would inquire as to why I wasn''t in class, I would quicken my pace, wave my clip board at him, and say, \"Student Body business, Father.\" Worked every single time, and the fast walk habit stuck with me.\\r\\n\"So, Larry, I really want to know, why do you have two women and no pussy?\"\\r\\n\"You know all about that. You know everything,\" he answered.\\r\\n\"You ever take your wife anywhere? You never say anything about that?\"\\r\\n\"Not for the past thirty years. That''s why I can still be a Catholic. I''m faithful to only one woman.\" Silence for too long. \"Okay,\" he continued. \"I know...my life is pretty fucked up.\"\\r\\nOn the green EdBob putted a twelve foot putt that went fifteen feet past the hole.\\r\\nYou''re stabbing at the ball, EdBob,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"Don''t coach, Tom,\" said EdBob. \"If I wanted lessons, I''d go to the pro shop.\"\\r\\n\"Just trying to help,\" said Tom. \"I think they got two inches tall.\"\\r\\n\"What?\" asked Larry.\\r\\n\"Her nipples,\" answered Tom. \"Isn''t that what we were talking about?\"\\r\\nHole #3, Par 4, HANDICAP #15, NOTE: DOGLEG RIGHT/WATER LEFT. .\\r\\n\"So, you going to tell me who it was last night, Tom?\" asked Larry , still sitting in his cart writing down scores from the second hole.\\r\\n\"Mary Stoop,\" answered Tom, as he used the ball washer.\\r\\n\"Blonde? About forty something?\"\\r\\n\"Yea,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"God,\" shouted Larry, suddenly abandoning his scorekeeping duties. \"She was a patient of mine. When I cleaned her teeth, she always wore a slinky blouse and no bra. She was married back then.\"\\r\\n\"Yeah, she talked about you. Said you always tried to look down her blouse. She''s still married,\" said Tom. \"She doesn''t own one. A bra, I mean. She says her breasts have to breathe.\"\\r\\n\"Republican, right wing bitch,\" I said, nodding toward the house next to the third tee box, and thinking of Toni, the woman who lived inside.\\r\\n\"Why don''t you let it go, Jack,\" said EdBob. \"Every time you get here, your game goes to hell for two or three holes.\"\\r\\nTwo or three months earlier I had gotten into a screaming match in the 19th Hole Lounge with Toni. I knew she had voted for Bush, and I made the mistake of asking her what she thought about Bush''s war we were losing.\\r\\n\"We need to stay the course,\" she said.\\r\\n\"Why?\" I asked her. \"And what course?\"\\r\\n\"It''s better to fight them over there than over here,\" she said between sips of iced tea. She was so right-wing, she didn''t even drink regular booze.\\r\\n\"Toni,\" I said, \"I''m trying to be calm, here. One easy question - Why did we invade Iraq?\"\\r\\n\"Helloooo,\" she said. \"Did you forget about Nine-Eleven? Did you forget they were building a newclear bomb to drop on us? Did you forget they were getting ready to send model airplanes to spray us with poison? Did you forget their, so called, god, Buddha, tells them to kill us all? Did you forget they were training Muslim terrorists?\"\\r\\n\"Helloooo,\" I answered. \"Iraq had nothing to do with Nine-Eleven. There were no weapons. Iraqis don''t believe in Buddha. Saddam was killing all the Muslim terrorists. There were no model airplanes. Everyone who can read knows this now, Toni. No wonder Bush won the election. Idiots like you, who don''t know their ass from a manhole cover, voted for him. There must be a lot of you retarded bitches out there.\"\\r\\nHer husband, a retired San Diego policeman, then beat the shit out of me, and Lisa, the bartender, banned me from the bar for a month\r\n.\\r\\n\"Let it go,\" EdBob said again. \"You''re going to screw up your round.\" But, it was too late. I hit my tee shot out of bounds to the right, into a guy''s back yard.\\r\\n\"Lot of anger in that swing,\" said Tom. \"When you cleaned her teeth, did you see her nipples, Larry? Why didn''t you drug her up? You could have looked all you wanted?\"\\r\\n\"You''re one, sick fucker,\" said EdBob, after hitting his first good tee shot down the left side of the fairway.\\r\\n\"At least I''m not sleeping in my garage,\" countered Tom. Moments later, after hitting his first bad drive of the day - high and short - Tom said, \"Sorry I said that, Partner. That was chickenshit.\r\n\"\\r\\n\"You''re right, Tom,\" said EdBob. \"That was chickenshit. I may have to tell Jack to kick your fat ass.\"\\r\\nI didn''t laugh, but the three others almost fell down laughing. I knew they were remembering the ass whipping I took in the bar.\\r\\n\"That''s not funny,\" I said, touching the small bump that remained under my left eye.\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said Tom, gasping for breath, tears streaming down his cheeks. \"We weren''t laughing at..\"\\r\\nHe couldn''t finish. He was laughing too hard.\\r\\nAt the green, EdBob''s ball was in the fringe, and he chipped it in for a par. \"I did that for you, Partner,\" he said, pointing at me.\\r\\n\"Jack''s not your partner, EdBob,\" said Larry. \"We''re playing Left/Right. Remember?\"\\r\\n\"I thought it was Partners,\" said Tom\\r\\nHole #4, PAR 5, 486 YARDS, #7 HANDICAP, NOTE: NOTE: TREES AND HOUSES ON RIGHT/ UP HILL LAST 50 YARDS.\\r\\n\"So, everyone is clear on the game we''re playing?\" said Larry, as he looked down the fourth fairway.\\r\\n\"All clear,\" said Tom. \"So, why don''t you divorce the bitch, EdBob?\"\\r\\n\"You don''t call a guy''s wife a bitch,\" I said, checking my scorecard. I was three over par after three holes. I was hoping for better after all the secret practicing I did during the week.\\r\\n\"He calls her bitch all the time,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"That doesn''t mean you can,\" I said. \"It''s like calling a black guy a nigger. If a black guy does it, it''s okay, but not you.\"\\r\\n\"I agree with EdBob,\" said Tom. \"We need to stop all the philosophy bullshit. I was just wondering why EdBob won''t get a divorce. You don''t have to analyze everything all the time, Jack.\"\\r\\nLarry said, \"What did you get on the last hole, EdBob.\"\\r\\n\"Par,\" said EdBob.\\r\\n\"Really?\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"You questioning my integrity?\" asked EdBob. \"You think I''m cheating at golf?\"\\r\\nThe code of golfers, even weekend hackers like us: You can cheat on your taxes, you can cheat on your wife, but, you never, never, never cheat at golf. All the guys with whom I played followed the code, no matter how they cheated off the golf course. Maybe if we never left the course, we''d all be eligible for heaven.\\r\\n\"Sorrreeeee,\" said Tom. \"I was just asking.\"\\r\\n\"Well, don''t ask,\" muttered EdBob.\\r\\nEdBob didn''t speak to anyone until we reached the fourth green. Then his words were mechanical: \"You want the flag out? Is my mark okay?\"\\r\\nA month or so earlier, Tom and EdBob almost got into an actual fistfight on the ninth tee. Tom''s false teeth stopped the fight before it began. He said he had to take them out before he could whip EdBob''s ass.\\r\\n\"If you have to take out your teeth before fighting, Tom,\" I said, \"maybe it''s a sign.\"\\r\\n\"If you''re saying I''m too old, I''m not. I still get a lot of pussy, man. And, I can whip EdBob''s ass on my worst day. I was in the Golden Gloves.\"\\r\\nLooking at Tom''s plumb, squatty body, Larry and I were struck with the contrast between our vision and his words, and could not contain our laughter. It was contagious, and the bomb was diffused. Even Tom laughed, just not as much as we did.\\r\\nI putted in from four feet for a bogie (another bogie). \"What''s the game score?\" I asked Larry.\\r\\n\"I think we''re all square. No blood.\"\\r\\n\"Bullshit,\" said Tom. \"EdBob parred the last hole. Didn''t that put us ahead?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Larry. \"Jack and I had strokes.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, that''s right,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"Are you questioning my integrity?\" asked Larry, mocking EdBob, making an effort at humor. No one laughed.\\r\\nHole #5, 404 YARDS, PAR 4, #1 HANDICAP. NOTE: NEED A LONG DRIVE.\\r\\nI told myself to swing easy - hit hard, but it didn''t work. At the top of my takeaway, I had the thought that that I could get my first 250 yard drive if I gave it just a little extra. I topped the ball. It dribbled forward just past the women''s tee.\\r\\n\"At least you don''t have to take your dick out,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"Real Man Rules,\" stated that if you did not drive your ball past the women''s tee, you had to hang your wanger out for the rest of the round to show that you were not a woman.\\r\\nI was angry. At myself. \"At least if I hung it, it would be visible,\" I said to Tom.\\r\\n\"You want to play ''Whip It Out'' right now?\" asked Tom.\\r\\n\"Whip It Out\" was an old grammar school game in which seventh grade boys compared their manhood with their peers.\\r\\n\"Jesus, Tom,\" said Larry. \"Grow up, man.\"\\r\\n\"First you tell me I''m old, then you tell me to grow up. What the fuck.\"\\r\\n\"I didn''t say you were too old, Tom,\" said Larry.\"\\r\\n\"Jack did. He said I had a little dick.\"\\r\\n\"Could we maybe get some golf in between all this bullshit?\" asked EdBob, just before he made his second good drive in a row.\\r\\nBack in the cart, Larry asked me why no one ever laughed at anything he said. I got the idea it bothered him.\\r\\n\"I don''t know,\" I said. \"I still want to know why you take care of two women and get no pussy.\"\\r\\n\"Jack, we''re almost sixty-five. Guy''s sixty-five don''t have sex. And, Rachel''s almost as old as I am. Remember when we were young guys? We thought old people screwing was really sick.\\r\\n\"That''s because we were young and dumb.\"\\r\\n\"I still think like that. How come EdBob got so quiet?\"\\r\\n\"You don''t have to tell old women what to do. They have all that experience. They know everything.\" I said. \"EdBob''s afraid of being alone, like all the rest of us.\"\\r\\nI''ve known EdBob for almost twenty years. His history with women has been rocky. wife, Carol, a counselor at the high school where EdBob teaches. I liked Carol, kind of. I wouldn''t have chosen her as a wife, but I thought she was okay for EdBob. She left EdBob because of EdBob. EdBob drinks. Carol told my wife that EdBob wasn''t a husband at all during their last few years of marriage. He drank and went out to his workshop where he made fishing lures.\\r\\nThe woman he is now married to (her name is Cindy) is a complete nut ball. Everything I know is second hand. She''s got one of those disorders that make her go crazy when she has even a drop of alcohol. She''s done violent things to EdBob. He has bite marks all over him. She beat on his golf cart with a seven iron. She smashed his car windshield with a hammer. I''ve seen all the damage, but I get only EdBob''s side of the story. Maybe Cindy has a story too, but I''ll never know.\\r\\nHole #6, 329 YARDS, PAR 4, HANDICAP #9. NOTE: BLIND TEE SHOT UP HILL. OUR OF BOUNDS AND SAND TRAP RIGHT, FOREST OF OAKS ON LEFT. I HATE THIS HOLE.\\r\\n\"I hate this hole,\" said EdBob, as he stopped his cart next to the tee.\\r\\n\"You''ve got to love it, EdBob,\" I said. \"As long as you have to play it, you might as well love it.\"\\r\\n\"Shut up, Jack,\" said Tom. \"I''ll bet you''ve never had bad sex.\"\\r\\n\"The worst sex I''ve ever had was sensational,\" I answered.\\r\\n\"I''m hitting,\" said Larry, teeing up his ball. \"It''s pretty hard for me to concentrate with all this bullshit going on all the time.\"\\r\\n\"It''s only golf, Larry,\" I said.\\r\\n\"Golf is the most fun thing in my life,\" said Larry.\\r\\n\"You like golf better than pussy?\" asked EdBob.\\r\\n\"Shut up, EdBob,\" said Larry, before hitting his shot into the oaks on the left.\\r\\n\"At least you''re not out of bounds,\" I said.\\r\\n\"Shut up, Jack,\" said Larry.\\r\\nI hit a good one, right down the middle to the top of the hill. \"Perfect,\" I said.\\r\\n\"You think every shot you hit is perfect,\" said Tom.\\r\\nSometimes I make myself sick. Tom was right. I tend to look for the silver lining. Find it even when it is not there. Maybe I''ve always been that way, or maybe I learned that as a high school football coach for forty years. During the bad years, when my teams were losing more than winning, I had to keep the kids hopeful. I had to come up with new goals and forget the old ones. I had to say things to them like, \"We''re going to play this last game for pride,\" and \"The next game is the only one that counts.\" Okay, it was kind of bullshit, but why make things worse than they have to be?\\r\\nTom had a bad sixth hole. He hit his tee shot out of bounds and then hit his second tee shot out of bounds. Then he said, \"Fuck it. I don''t give a shit,\" before stomping back to EdBob''s cart, sitting down in the passenger seat, folding his arms across his chest, and pouting. \"I''m out of the hole,\" he muttered.\\r\\n\"Jesus, Tom. It''s only golf, man,\" I said\\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said EdBob.\\r\\nTom said, \"Why do you let her treat you that way?\"\\r\\n\"He likes being treated that way,\" I said. \"Leave him alone.\"\\r\\n\"Why do you think you always have all the answers, Jack?\" said Tom, still pouting in the cart.\\r\\n\"Okay, I''ll shut up,\" I said, vowing to say nothing else for the rest of the round.\\r\\nLarry, driving me up the hill to where my ball lay, said, \"Hope I can find my ball. I wonder why Tom is so pissed.\"\\r\\n\"You''ll find it,\" I said, hoping I would not have to help him look. I hated looking for missing balls unless they were mine. I am selfish that way. \"Tom''s pissed because he''s Tom. After his next good shot, he''ll be fine. He doesn''t get all the women he says he gets.\"\\r\\n\"How do you know?\"\\r\\n\"If he did, he wouldn''t talk about it all the time.\"\\r\\nEven though Tom was out of the hole, it took a long time for us to complete number six. We looked for Larry''s ball for more than five minutes, which is the limit according to golf rules, but no one called a penalty. When we finally found it, Larry had no shot, but he tried anyhow and ended up with a triple bogie.\\r\\n\"All that practice,\" said Larry, scowling and writing down his score.\\r\\nHole #7, Par 4, 372 yards, #11 handicap. Notes: flat, not much trouble right or left. Almost boring.\\r\\nTom teed off on number seven even before we were off the number six green. \"We need to pick up the pace,\" he called, after hitting a good shot. He was looking at the foursome behind us who were standing on the top of the hill, looking down at the green. They all had their hands on their hips - the universal golf sign for \"Get a move on.\"\\r\\n\"Excuse me,\" said Larry. \"I lost a ball. Am I the only golfer to ever have to look for a ball?\"\\r\\n\"It''s time to change partners,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"We''re not playing partners,\" I said. \"We''re playing Left and Right.\"\\r\\n\"I thought we were playing Wolf,\" said EdBob.\\r\\n\"I''m keeping score for Left and Right,\" said Larry, \"but anything is okay with me.\" He drove his ball down the right side into the rough.\\r\\n\"You and Jack were partners for the first six holes,\" said Tom. \"Now I''ll toss a tee to see who my partner is now.\" Tom tossed the tee. It pointed at Larry.\\r\\nI took my bag off of Larry''s cart and strapped it onto EdBob''s. EdBob drove his ball left into the fairway bunker.\\r\\n\"Who won the first six holes?\" I asked.\\r\\n\"I don''t know,\" said Larry. \"I''ll have to figure that out. I was keeping score for Left and Right.\"\\r\\nI popped my ball up. Very short, but down the middle.\\r\\nTom loaded his bag onto Larry''s cart and hopped in the passenger seat. \"How can anyone play with EdBob?\" he asked Larry, loud enough for EdBob to hear. \"I feel an ass kickin'' coming on now that I have a real partner.\"\\r\\n\"We''ll see about that,\" I said. \"EdBob and I are the A Team.\"\\r\\n\"A for assholes,\" said Tom, laughing, as Larry sped away.\\r\\n\"Don''t let Tom get back into my cart,\" said EdBob, as he drove me to my ball.\\r\\n\"How come?\" I asked.\\r\\n\"He gives advice. He tells me to divorce Cindy, just because she beats up my cart and my car and bites me all over. She''s getting better, Jack. Swear to God.\"\\r\\n\"I don''t give advice, EdBob.\"\\r\\n\"I know. That''s why I like you riding in my cart. Jack, if you wanted to give me advice, what would you tell me about Cindy?\"\\r\\n\"I don''t even know Cindy. I don''t know your wife, EdBob.\"\\r\\n\"She''s a real bitch, Jack.\"\\r\\n\"Well, I''ve heard she''s done some evil things to you.\"\\r\\n\"She told me she was going to come on the golf course and fuck up our round today.\"\\r\\n\"No way.\"\\r\\n\"Way,\" said EdBob.\\r\\n\"Well, let''s not worry about it right now. Let''s just focus on golf.\"\\r\\n\"That''s what we''re here for, right?\"\\r\\nEdBob''s second shot went way off line to the right, into the street where it struck a passing UPS truck, rocketed back toward the green, and stopped in the short fringe just ten feet from the flag stick.\\r\\n\"I call major bullshit on that,\" said Tom. \"There''s got to be a rule about that. Your ball was out of bounds, EdBob.\"\\r\\n\"Was, is the key word, Tom,\" I said, defending my partner.\\r\\n\"It hit a moving vehicle. I''m checking this out when we make the turn.\"\\r\\n\"I know it''s okay, Tom,\" said Larry. \"It''s the same as if it hit a house out of bounds.\"\\r\\n\"Houses don''t speed down the fucking road at sixty miles an hour, for christsakes,\" said Tom. \"This is major bullshit.\"\\r\\n\"I think it''s bullshit too,\" said Larry, \"but I think it''s minor. Let''s just keep playing, Tom.\"\\r\\nAt the green EdBob putted his ball to within six inches, turned to Tom and said, \"That good?\"\\r\\nTom would normally \"give\" a putt that short, but now he said, \"Mark it or putt it.\"\\r\\n\"Fuck you, Tom,\" said EdBob, before tapping in his putt. He then turned to me and said \"We''ve been partners for one hole, and we''re already ahead by one.\" He then laughed. Tom''s putt ended about two feet from the hole. \"Mark it or putt it,\" said EdBob.\\r\\n\"It''s for a five,\" said Tom. \"It doesn''t matter.\"\\r\\n\"Mark it or putt it,\" EdBob repeated.\\r\\n\"Can''t we all just get along,\" said Larry.\\r\\nAfter missing his short putt, Tom said, \"I''ll never be able to get along with that penis head.\"\\r\\nHole #8, PAR 3, 178 YARDS, #13 HANDICAP. NOTE: SANDTRAPS LEFT AND RIGHT AND BACK.\\r\\nNo one hit the eighth green, the way the good golfers do. I was in the sand trap on the right. EdBob was down the middle but fifty yards short.\\r\\n\"One up, one in, and you''ve got your par, EdBob,\" I said to my partner.\\r\\n\"With my luck, I''ll probably hit in the sand trap,\" said EdBob. EdBob''s next shot went into the sand trap on the left. \"See what I mean?\"\\r\\n\"Well, if you have those negative thoughts, it screws up your swing.\"\\r\\n\"Wouldn''t you have negative thoughts if you had Cindy for a wife? What if you had to sleep in the garage? Wouldn''t you be a little negative?\"\\r\\nEdBob drove me to the green. \"I should probably divorce her,\" he said to me. \"What do you think?\"\\r\\n\"I don''t know,\" I said, looking at my ball in the sand trap and thinking about my shot. \"I don''t even know her, EdBob.\"\\r\\n\"You know she''s a bitch. I told you what a bitch she is.\"\\r\\nWhen I was over my ball, EdBob shut up. I hit the shot to thin. It skidded across the green and into the sand trap on the opposite side.\\r\\n\"At least you don''t have to change clubs,\" said Tom. He turned to Larry, hoping Larry was laughing. He wasn''t.\\r\\nLarry said, \"He probably feels bad enough.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, Jesus,\" said Tom. \"What are we doing here, playing the U.S. fucking Open? It''s only golf, for christsakes.\"\\r\\nTom chipped his ball to within six inches. I said, \"That''s good, Tom.\" Tom picked up the ball.\\r\\n\"I didn''t give you that putt,\" said EdBob.\\r\\n\"Your partner gave it to me,\" said Tom.\\r\\nLarry putted from off the green and went way past the hole.\\r\\n\"But I didn''t give it to you. Both guys on the opponent''s team have to give it to you.\"\\r\\n\"I gave him the putt, EdBob,\" I said. \"Shut up and let me hit my ball.\" I made a better sand shot this time but still had to putt twice and took a double bogie.\\r\\nEdBob also ended with a double bogie.\\r\\n\"Good ass whipping,\" Tom said to Larry, as the two walked off the green. \"We''re tied. I knew I''d start playing better when I got a partner who wasn''t a fuck face.\"\\r\\nWhen we got back to EdBob''s cart, all four tires were flat\r\n.\\r\\n\"All your tires are flat, EdBob,\" said Larry.\\r\\n\"The bitch,\" shouted EdBob. \"She told me she was going to foul up our round.\"\\r\\n\"What are you going to do about it, EdBob?\" asked Tom.\\r\\n\"Maybe it wasn''t her,\" said EdBob.\\r\\n\"It was her, EdBob,\" said Larry, pulling an ice pick from the back tire. \"She left the ice pick in the back tire. Who else?\"\\r\\n\"That does it for me. I''m going to have to confront her on this one.\"\\r\\nLarry called the pro shop on his cell phone. Jason, one of the assistant pros, came out with a cart for EdBob and me, and the marshal, Dave, said he could fix the ice pick damage. He towed EdBob''s cart and Jason back to the cart barn.\\r\\nHole #9, PAR 4, 375 YARDS, #5 HANDICAP. NOTE: SECOND SHOT OVER A STREAM, SAND TRAPS ALL AROUND THE GREEN. .\\r\\nTom and I hit our tee shots close to one another. EdBob dropped me off at my ball and took off in search of his, which he had pulled to the left. So, Tom and I were standing by our respective balls waiting for the old gentlemen to clear the green.\\r\\n\"Marilyn Stoop knows you, Jack,\" said Tom. \"She told me last night.\"\\r\\n\"Yea,\" I said. \"I know Marilyn Stoop. I coached her kid. Look at those thunderheads. I think they''re coming our way.\" Why can''t women keep their mouths shut about their excursions off the reservation? It was just one afternoon. Not even the night. And, that was five or six years ago.\\r\\nEveryone thought I was a saint because I never talked about sex very much. In an almost imperceptible way, I displayed disdain toward my three golf buddies because of their women problems. I was above all that.\\r\\nOkay, it''s hard to be perfect. My wife was on a trip with her girlfriend to Alaska, on a cruise ship, for ten days. I was lonely. I was horny. I wanted to be young again.\\r\\nAt three o''clock on a Monday afternoon, Marilyn Stoop and I were the only two in the 19th Hole Lounge. Lisa had already served me two beers and had served Marilyn Stoop two martinis \"in a bucket, on ice.\" I paid for her second drink.\\r\\nWe talked.\\r\\nWe went to my house.\\r\\nWe fucked.\\r\\nI asked her to stay the night, but she said she had to get home to fix dinner.\\r\\nThat was it. That was all there was. I''ve been a saint ever since, although I still have fantasies about those crazy, elevating nipples.\\r\\n\"How about those nipples?\" asked Tom.\\r\\n\"I''m thinking about my shot, Tom. Would you shut the fuck up?\"\\r\\nWe tied the hole. No blood. Match still even.\\r\\nAt the turn, EdBob and Tom went to the snack bar, and Larry and I went into the pro shop to check on our Tuesday tee time. The assistant pro, Leon, was behind the counter.\\r\\n\"You have seven twenty-two,\" he told us, before we asked. \"And, tell EdBob his wife rented a cart this morning. Charged it to EdBob. She only had it for fifteen minutes. I''m not going to charge him.\"\\r\\n\"Thanks, Leon,\" said Larry. \"I''ll tell him.\"\\r\\nHOLE #10, PAR 4, 351 YARDS, HANDICAP # 12 NOTE: THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY HOLD. WATER WAY LEFT, FAIRWAY SAN RIGHT, W"ID"E FAIRWAY.\\r\\nTo Tom''s credit he didn''t tell everyone about me and Marilyn Stoop, but now he knew I couldn''t say anything about him. Nothing negative. Nothing about him being a womanizer.\\r\\n\"How come you''re such a womanizer, Tom?\" asked EdBob, as he teed up on the tenth. \"Don''t you get good poon at home?\"\\r\\n\"Jesus,\" said Larry,\" is that all you guys ever talk about? Why can''t we talk about movies or books or cars once in a while?\"\\r\\n\"EdBob can''t read,\" explained Tom. Then he laughed.\\r\\n\"I read,\" said EdBob, \"if there''s something worth reading. All the books Jack gives me are bullshit.\" He looked at me. \"I don''t mean they''re bullshit for you, Jack, but for me they''re bullshit. All the Grisham books are movies. And the other stuff, like 1776, I already know we won the fucking war.\"\\r\\nI don''t blame EdBob. When I read something that fires me up, I want everyone else to be fired up too. It never works. I like a lot of things my golf buds don''t like, and they like a lot of things I don''t like. EdBob does the New York Times crossword puzzle every day. Tom reads the fish report every day and takes overnight trips on boats to catch albacore. Larry is into cars. He just bought a Ferrari. Cost him over one hundred thousand dollars. I like reading books. When I talk about books, when Larry talks about fast cars, when EdBob talks about his crosswords, when Tom talks about fishing, everyone ends up telling every one else to shut the fuck up and play golf. Maybe that''s why the major topic of conversation always reverts to pussy. All of us agree that pussy is a good thing. Some of us still like it. Some of us can only think back to the time when it was our religion.\\r\\n\"I get good poon at home,\" said Tom, before teeing off and pulling his ball way left and almost into the water. \"Why would you even ask such a dumb question, EdBob?\"\\r\\n\"Just wondered why you''re out chasing poontang all the time.\"\\r\\nBack in the cart EdBob said to me, \"Tom''s pretty fucked up, and he doesn''t know how fucked up he is.\"\\r\\n\"We''re all a little fucked up, EdBob,\" I said.\\r\\n\"I''m not,\" said EdBob. \"Not when I get things worked out with Cindy.\"\\r\\n\"I''d like to win this hole,\" I said. \"I like our chances. Tom''s in trouble over there by the water. I think I felt a rain drop.\r\n\"\\r\\nEdBob''s second shot was ugly. It never got off the ground, but it rolled and rolled and stopped just off the front of the green. \"I like it,\" said EdBob. \"Easy par from there.\"\\r\\nMy second shot was a good one. It landed on the green and rolled about fifteen feet past the hole. I would have a downhill putt for birdie.\\r\\nLarry shanked his second far right and almost out of bounds. \"Fuck me blue,\" he shouted, as he slammed his six iron into the turf. \"I hit these great in practice.\"\\r\\nTom hit into the water and started pouting again.\\r\\nEdBob and I won the hole to go one up.\\r\\nHOLE #11, PAR 5, 496 YARDS, #2 HANDICAP, NOTE: HIT SECOND SHOT OVER WATER, OR PLAY IT SAFE AND LAY UP.\\r\\n\"These teams aren''t fair,\" I said to EdBob. \"Too easy for us.\" I made sure I spoke loudly enough for Tom and Larry to hear.\\r\\nTom stopped pouting and became aggressive.\\r\\n\"I''m getting a little tired of your ''I''m above it all'' attitude, Jack,\" said Tom, glaring at me. \"I know you''re not perfect, if you know what I mean.\"\\r\\n\"What does he mean?\" asked Larry, as he followed us to the tee.\\r\\n\"Ask Tom,\" I said. \"Tom knows everything.\" Larry didn''t ask, at least not right then.\\r\\nBack in the cart, after all of us hit acceptable tee shots, EdBob asked me, \"What did Tom mean?\"\\r\\n\"I never know what Tom means. I agree with you; Tom''s fucked up.\"\\r\\nAnd that''s true. I knew he was a mess the day I met him nine or ten years ago. He and I were just a twosome late on a weekday afternoon. We were standing on the same eleventh tee. Suddenly, Tom ran off the tee and hid behind an oleander bush. He stayed there for two or three minutes. When he returned, he teed off, got back into the cart, and said nothing. Because I had just met him, I didn''t inquire as to his behavior, but I was thinking, This guy is pretty fucked up.\\r\\nFinally, he said, \"You probably think I''m pretty fucked up. But, my wife can''t see me here. I think I saw her car coming up the road.\"\\r\\n\"Why can''t she see you?\" I asked\\r\\n\"Because I can never lie to her. I told her I would never lie to her again. I told her that in front of the counselor. So, shit.\"\\r\\n\"Okay,\" I said. And that''s as far as that conversation got.\\r\\nSince then, I''ve gotten to know a lot about Tom, because Tom tells everything. Tom makes a lot of money selling insulation to big housing contractors. When in college he was on the USC golf team. He''s got a love hate thing going with his wife. She looks Asian to me. He and his wife go to marriage counselors. Four or five years ago he fell in love with a girl he met at a sales convention. His wife found out and left him. He was devastated. When he had her name tattooed on his ass, she returned. They are still together, but they still go to a marriage counselor.\\r\\nAs we reached the eleventh green, large, dark clouds gathered over us, and the wind blew off EdBob''s hat and took it fifty yards up the fairway. We were all able to blame our missed putts on the weather. \"Tiger Woods couldn''t putt in this wind,\" said Tom, when he missed his putt.\\r\\nHOLE #12, PAR 3, 130 YARDS, #18 HANDICAP (easiest hole on the course), NOTE: TEE SHOT ACROSS WATER.\\r\\nThe rain became serious as the four of us approached the twelfth tee.\\r\\n\"A little rain never hurt anyone,\" said Larry. \"Rain is like part of nature. We''re meant to thrive in rain.\"\\r\\n\"Jesus,\" said EdBob. He was putting on his rain gear he carried in his golf bag. \"Could we give the touchy feely bullshit a little break?\"\\r\\nThen we saw the first lightning, and moments later heard a horrendous thunder clap.\\r\\n\"I''m getting the fuck out of here,\" said Tom, moving off the tee and toward his cart.\\r\\n\"These things usually last just a few minutes, Tom.\" I said. \"Let''s wait a while. You don''t want to quit just because you''re behind, do you, Tom?\"\\r\\n\"We''re not behind,\" said Tom. Another flash of lightning. The rain increased. More thunder.\\r\\n\"We''d better get out of here,\" said Larry. \"You know what happens if you get struck by lightning?\"\\r\\n\"You guys are pussies,\" said EdBob, in full rain garb, teeing up his ball. The wind blew his ball off the tee.\\r\\nThe next lightning struck an oak tree near the twelfth green. A large limb fell to the ground and smoke rose from the injured tree.\\r\\nEdBob ran to his cart without retrieving his ball that had blown to the back of the tee box. \"Tom''s right,\" he said. \"We''d better go.\"\\r\\nBy the time we got into the 19th Hole Lounge, all of us, except EdBob, were soaked to the skin.\\r\\n\"If it stops, we''re going to finish,\" I said, after sitting down at the bar and asking Lisa to pour me a brandy. Lisa was still my friend, even though she eighty-sixed me for what I said to Toni.\\r\\n\"I''m not going back out,\" said Tom. \"Miller Light, Lisa?\"\\r\\n\"Not until you say please,\" said Lisa, after putting my brandy in front of me.\\r\\n\"Please,\" said Tom.\\r\\nLarry sat to my left and EdBob to my right. Tom sat next to EdBob. I had the best seat, right over the sink. That''s where Lisa leaned over to wash glasses.\\r\\n\"If you don''t go back out, you forfeit the match,\" said EdBob. \"My regular, Lisa, please.\" EdBob''s regular was bourbon and diet coke.\\r\\n\"I''m calling bullshit on that right now,\" said Tom, before taking his first sip of beer.\\r\\n\"That would only be fair, Tom,\" said Larry, after ordering a ginger ale.\\r\\n\"You''re the only man in the whole club who drinks ginger ale,\" said Lisa.\\r\\n\"How is the gay life treating you, Larry?\" asked Tom.\\r\\n\"Don''t start, Tom,\" said Larry. \"You know I''m not queer, don''t you, Lisa?\"\\r\\n\"I know, Larry,\" said Lisa, smiling. \"Tom just babbles.\" She leaned over to wash a glass.\\r\\n\"How did the matches end up, Larry?\" asked EdBob.\\r\\n\"Scorecard got pretty wet,\" said Larry after sipping his ginger ale. \"I think EdBob and I won the first six holes when we were playing Left and Right\" Larry was dabbing the soaked scorecard with a paper napkin.\\r\\n\"I didn''t think we were ever playing Left and Right,\" I said.\\r\\n\"We were playing Partners,\" said Tom.\\r\\n\"Not until the seventh hole,\" said Larry. \"I thought that was when we switched.\"\\r\\nEdBob said, \"Am I the only guy who can keep anything straight around here? We were playing Wolf.\"\\r\\n\"I''m not paying,\" said Tom, as he finished his beer. \"And, I''m going home. See you boys next Saturday,\" said Tom, patting each of us on the back before leaving.\\r\\n\"Talk about your poor losers,\" said EdBob, after Tom left. \"Give me another, Lisa?\"\\r\\n\"I''m out of here, too,\" I said, after tossing down the last of my drink. \"What''s our time for next week?\"\\r\\n\"He''ll call,\" said EdBob, nodding at Larry.\\r\\n\"I''ll call everyone,\" confirmed Larry.\\r\\nWhen I got the parking lot, the rain had stopped.\r\n', 'A Saturday Round of Golf by Michael J.

Her neighbor, Lara, volunteered to help her in the garage this spring morning for the sale, so Elizabeth let her pile the boy''s clothing and re-write some of the prices she''d written earlier on masking tape and little cardboard signs. She didn''t know what price at all to put on some items.\\r\\nShe straightened, tucked, folded every size from infant to eight. She didn''t mind it, but she should sit down because she felt so drained, she only took time today to put on an old house dress that came to her calves. Her stockings were still rolled down to her slippers, and her hair straggled over the creases in her forehead. She knew she didn''t look perky, but what could you expect after all this? It was a lot of work preparing for-- Still, she had to get rid of the stuff, and it seemed better to sell it rather than give it all away. Not for the money, no. But the words, \"get rid of\" bothered her, like it didn''t matter.\\r\\n\"Am I doing the right thing?\" Elizabeth asked her neighbor.\\r\\nLara was holding a small blanket to her face, as if she weren''t sure she should put the price tag on it. \"It''s so soft,\" she said, smiling. \"But yes, to answer your question. It''s the right thing to do. Remember, it''s just a little sale. But are you sure you want to sell this, Elizabeth?\"\\r\\n\"Yes. And that riding toy over there.\" She pointed. \"I saved everything I could. There''s no more room.\"\\r\\nThey heard a screech, and Elizabeth looked anxiously to see who stopped so suddenly in front of the house. A man climbed down from his truck, shoved his hands deep into his pockets, and studied the bicycle Elizabeth had for sale on the lawn. It looked like new. Elizabeth had fixed it--new tires, spokes, paint--\\r\\n\"What do you want for this?\" the man asked, kicking the tires.\\r\\n\"The price is listed,\" Elizabeth said. She pressed her lips together. Why''d he feel he had to kick the tires? What did that tell him?\\r\\nHe peered at the tag hanging over the handlebars. \"One-hundred and twenty-five dollars? That''s more than the cost of a new one!\"\\r\\n\"It''s better than new.\"\\r\\n\"You won''t come down at all?\"\\r\\nElizabeth ambled inside the garage and busied herself behind a table, re-arranging some of the other items she had for sale--a deck of cards, a board game, an old football.\\r\\nLara touched her arm, glanced at the man beside the bike and back at Elizabeth.\\r\\n\"What do you want, lady, the moon?\" the man said, coming into the garage.\\r\\n\"One-hundred dollars,\" Elizabeth said. \"That''s the lowest I can come down.\"\\r\\n\"Look, I''ll give you ninety-five. Ninety-five dollars. That''s only five dollars'' difference.\"\\r\\n\"So what''s five more then?\"\\r\\n\"I can buy a brand new bike for less! Down at the discount store, I can buy one for sixty-nine right now. On sale.\"\\r\\nShe turned her back to him, pretended to take something down off the wall. \"Then buy it.\"\\r\\n\"All right. I''ll give you ninety-eight.\"\\r\\n\"It''s worth more. Much more.\"\\r\\n\"Listen,\" he said, handing her a card with his telephone number on it when she turned around, \"if you change your mind--\" He started to walk away, out onto the lawn.\\r\\n\"Wait.\" Elizabeth followed him to the lawn. She thought, he''s a businessman who''ll resell for twice as much and make a profit off a poor...\\r\\nA car tore down the street--and Elizabeth''s hands flew to her cheeks. Children were playing baseball in the street. She held her breath, heard shouts and a screech of brakes, then the motor gunning again. She strained her eyes. The children moved to the front yard to play now. Elizabeth breathed a sigh of relief.\\r\\n\"You have my number,\" the man said. \"I''ll be waiting for your call.\"\\r\\n\"I changed my mind.\" She was still watching the children down the street. \"I don''t want to sell it now. Not at all.\" She returned to the garage. Especially not to you, she almost said.\\r\\nThe man ran his hand over the bike''s smooth red paint, tapped the seat.\\r\\n\"I wouldn''t touch that bike if I were you, Mister,\" Lara said, \"not at any price.\"\\r\\nHe shrugged. \"But what''s the matter with her? I''m offering a reasonable amount--a good price. What''s the matter with her that she can''t come down a bit?\"\\r\\n\"She''s already come down as low as she can.\"\\r\\n\"Lady--\" He ignored Lara, reappeared in the garage where Elizabeth was looking for a chair to sit on. \"Lady, your last asking price was one-hundred dollars. I''ll give you ninety-nine dollars, and that''s my final offer. Take it or leave it.\"\\r\\nThe blood rushed to Elizabeth''s face, and she clenched her fists until they whitened. She raised her fists at him, shook them out like someone clutching a steering wheel. The man backed away.\\r\\nLara guided the bike into the garage and grasped the door handle. \"We''ll find room,\" she said.\\r\\nElizabeth let her tired arms drop. She paced toward a door that led into the house, then turned around and followed the man to his truck. She wanted to explain to him, if she could explain. But he''d already jumped into his truck. He screeched his tires, and drove off in a huff.\\r\\nElizabeth flinched. \"You be careful!\" she called. She pointed down the street where a ball had rolled.\\r\\nShe came back to the garage. \"He was a good boy,\" she said to Lara. \"My son. He was a good boy.\" She lowered her head.\\r\\n\"Of course he was,\" Lara said.\\r\\nElizabeth shook her head back and forth. \"I didn''t mean it.\"\\r\\n\"I know. I know.\" Lara patted her arm.\\r\\n\"It was an accident.

(517, 1, '2016-08-12 12:28:32', '2016-08-12 20:28:32', 'I was, I suppose you could say, in a PREpartum depression.\n\nIt started when my wife, Connie, decided it was time to have a baby. I was thirty-one and she was twenty-eight, a circumstance which I reminded her in my argument against the idea was no cause for alarm. But after she''d voiced her ambition--and thereby made it real to herself--the achievement of motherhood became an obsession for her and she would not leave me alone about it. Finally, after several months, my reluctance to enlist in her project compelled her to resort to a not so veiled threat: \"Steven,\" she said. \"Either we have a baby now or I''m going to leave you.\"\n\nAll right, I told her, get off the fucking Ovril then.\n\nNow it wasn''t that I never wanted a baby, and not that when I had one I didn''t want it to be with Connie. Strong of character and will, nurturing, quick-witted and sometimes astonishingly perceptive (not to mention pretty), Connie was a terrific wife and more than qualified to be an exceptional mother. The notion of one day having a family with her was hardly repugnant to me.\n\nNo. What troubled me when the prospect became imminent--what troubled me immensely--was a consequence inherent in the making of a baby, a consequence that I could not stop recognizing. Fathering a child would tie me into the hideous plan that Creation has devised for everything corporeal. I would be, and by my own hand, replacing myself. Once the deed was done, once I had accomplished the only thing we know with any certainty Creation wants of us, I would be, in Creation''s estimation, expendable.\n\nIf Connie, born Catholic but now earnestly New Age in her faiths and sentiments, soothed her fear of death by believing in reincarnation, I was a secular Jew and so had only the void to anticipate. And if I''d always been keenly tuned to the price of existence, and lived in a perpetual state of medium-grade anxiety as a result, my heightened appreciation of my mortality destroyed any semblance of internal equilibrium I could claim. With Connie''s demand the sinister underside of nature had turned itself toward me and it wouldn''t turn away.

We were both in our late twenties, we both had wives and small children and were struggling to get through college and on to a better life.\\r\\nWe met in Calculus class and hooked up the first day because it turned out that we were in the wrong Calculus class and shared a bonding moment of embarrassment. For the next three years, until we graduated, we were Ray-and-Bill, never just Ray, never just Bill.\\r\\nI tutored Bill in all his math classes and dragged him through his ignorance to graduation. Bill tutored me in life.\\r\\nA quiet man, Bill taught me that it takes courage to be a father and faith to be a husband. He taught me that I’m not beneath anyone, but it costs nothing to say, “Yes, sir” or “Yes, Ma’am.” He taught me that friends are more precious than things and that the truth is the only currency between friends. He taught me how to love a woman with my eyes, even in a crowded room, and that fish are a gift of laughter.\\r\\nBill was not an outwardly sentimental man, but he understood, and he made me understand, that he was my friend. When we graduated and wound up working at schools a hundred miles apart, we got together as often as we could and took our boys camping and fishing, or cooked out at his house or mine. He definitely taught me the proper way to grill a good steak.\\r\\nJust before Bill died, I hadn’t heard from him in a few months and I had begun to question the genuineness of his friendship. As I stood next to his bed in the hospital, his face ravaged by the stroke, and waited for some word from him, some chance to apologize for not calling him, he taught me with silence the terrible price of love. And when he woke for the last time and asked me with his eyes to please let him go, I learned more about my own selfishness than anyone ever should.\\r\\nAt Bill’s funeral, with hundreds of his students, friends and family filling the tiny church and the grassy parking lot beyond, his widow took my hand and asked me to stand with her at the casket. As countless strangers filed by to pay their last respects, so many of them shook my hand and called me by my name and told me how Bill had always talked about me, and how obvious it was that he had loved and admired me.

(522, 1, '2016-08-18 09:33:04', '2016-08-18 17:33:04', 'Our child, Jilly Nines, will be starting kindergarten in September and last night we participated in our first parent''s night at school. We, and about eighty other parents, met the principal, the school psychologist, all five kindergarten teachers, the administrative director, two first grade teachers, the librarian, the art teacher, the physical education teacher, the night custodian, the director of the PTA, the PTA fund-raising coordinator, the director of bi-lingual education, the director of transportation, the speech pathologist, the director of the PTA communications office, four teacher''s aides and someone else. Almost all of the teachers were endowed with a charming, youthful silhouette. None looked like they could deliver the thunderous reprimands of the Sister Christopher of my youth. The night custodian, a charming woman about my age, fifty-x, looked as if she could have snapped my neck in the wink of an eye.\\r\\nWe learned there will be about ninety new kindergartners and five different kindergarten classes in the school. Two of the classes will be bi-lingual.\\r\\nAll of this took place at ''Neath Lake Elementary School. This is the same place that my dad, Jilly''s grandfather went to school from 1924 - 1935 (first grade through high school).\r\nBy the end of the meeting, three things occurred to me:\\r\\n1. In order to assure a heterogeneous (a word which should only be written with a space between each letter thusly -- h e t e r o g e n e o u s) I''ll start again. In order to assure a h e t e r o g e n e o u s student population in kindergarten, as mandated by New York State law, all new kindergarten students must be screened by school officials prior to admission. I guess this applies to schools that will have multiple incoming classes as well as to provide some Department of Education number cruncher some raw data in order to prove something to someone. The children, we learned would be tested in six categories: Large Motor Skills; Cognitive Skills; Language Skills; Shape Shifting; and Cookie Eating. We were assured any number of times that this was not a test and that our children could not fail. We were told that the results of this non-testing could not, would not, should not be shared with the child''s parents. That the information would only be used to assure a h e t e r o g e n e o u s classroom population.\\r\\nI have always known, and confirmed last night, that I am, for the most part, a very accepting and trusting individual. This can be evidenced by the fact that after we were informed of the fail-safe screening, I had no questions for the school officials. I did not even ask if someone should have spell checked the principal''s presentation. Oh, h e t e r o g e n e o u s was spelled well enough but I am still wondering what I should tell them Jilly''s \"heigth\" is. My other co-parents though are not quite as trusting and what occurred to me, after about the two-hundred-seventy-sixth question about kindergarten screening from only about six of the other seventy-nine parents in the room, was that there was another kind of screening taking place right in front of my eyes and it was this: These teachers, in order to survive the school year are going to have to ASSURE that these six parents have their children in separate classrooms. Otherwise, the lovely and patient Mrs. Greenhild will probably go postal (or hombre postaleros if they end up in her bi-lingual education program).\\r\\n2. Everyone at my job is \"Bill,\" \"Bob,\" \"Ruth,\" \"Sarah,\" \"Lester,\" \"Asshole Trevor,\" or \"etc.\" What I mean is everyone is on a \"first name\" or \"epithet and first name basis.\" At school, it turns out that everyone is: Mrs. Greenhild, Mr. Ingram, Mrs. Lipton-Soupmix. I cannot handle this. I have to get on a first name basis with these people in a hurry or I''ll be as afraid to address them as I am to order a double-mocha-cino-mora-java-llada-roma at Starbucks. It''s intimidating. I just want to be able to say to Jilly''s teacher, \"So, Julie are we having fun learning?\" or \"Jules, are we up to speed on the shape shifting thing yet?\" (I do plan to refer to Jilly as \"we\" in school as I am prepared to take 100% responsibility for everything related to \"our\" schooling because there is no way she is getting away with the stuff that I got away with.) So, I am pretty sure the road to this kind of relationship with the staff at Jilly''s school is paved with money. Money that flows to the school in new ways. New Money. Money for a class trip to a herbologist. Maybe a new laptop for the Department of Education number cruncher. I have to get involved. I have to volunteer. I have to attend meetings. I have to vote in the school board election. I have to, well, to use the ''f'' word. I have to fund-raise. So this constitutes fair warning. Be prepared to buy, from me, at a significant mark-up: wrapping paper, books, chocolate, costume jewelry, magazine subscriptions, doilies. Save your money. You name it. We''re selling it. You''re buying it.\\r\\n3. I cried as we were leaving the school. My father walked these halls eighty years ago. He had his whole life ahead of him and he decided to have children instead. I am eternally grateful. Last night, all of the teachers, administrators, therapists talked about the children, our children, my child as if they really liked children. As if they liked my child. Already. Not ever having met her. They were articulate about what the children do each day at school. They knew when school started. They knew when school ended. They were teaching over the summer. And they were attending a meeting at 7:30 in the evening with seventy-four reasonable and six treacherously aggressive parents. Do you know how many people who work at my office would attend a 7:30PM meeting? Well, other than Asshole Trevor, no one would.\\r\\n\r\nSo, we''ve made first contact with our child''s educators. I hope I can behave like an adult which I think I can as long as no one tries to teach me the correct use of the semi;colon. \\r\\n<em>You can read more of Koe Whitton-Williams'' writing at <a href=\"http://www.thehalflifeoflinoleum.blogspot.com\">www.thehalflifeoflinoleum.blogspot.com</a></em>', 'First Contact by Koe Whitton-Williams', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', '99-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-08-18 09:33:04', '2016-08-18 17:33:04', '', 99, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/99-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The type of shoes that gave her blisters on the heels of her feet that hindered her ability to walk distances longer than five minutes. Then again, she hadn’t planned on wandering around, speaking to nothing. Her nose was running from the tears, but instead of reaching into her pocket and pulling out the Kleenex she had brought, she wiped it on the shoulder of her sleeve. Screw personal hygiene.\\r\\nIt was hot and humid out, not the keenest day to be outdoors. The smart, would be inside their air-conditioned houses sipping lemonade, watching comedy Wednesdays on TV. Instead, Lanie searched.\\r\\n“It has to be here. It has to.” She whispered, exhausted. “It just has to be.” She checked the next headstone. ‘DORNBUSH’ it read. She was beginning to think the person she was looking for didn’t exist. She had to exist. She’d visited this place enough times to know where it was. They don’t just unbury bodies and replant them elsewhere! A new set of tears brimmed her eyelids, and another choking cry escaped. She didn’t care who was watching, it was a graveyard, for cripes sake. Crying was okay, it was practically mandatory.\\r\\nShe was lost. She’d covered the same length of distance at least three times, and still nothing. “This is where it was, this is the area you always were. I remember. I remember seeing you. Why can’t this just be easy.” Something in her life had to be right, had to be easy. Everything she seemed to do of late was horrible, or disapproving. Lanie needed to find her. She was the one person in this world who couldn’t judge her, or yell at her, or tell her she was a screw up. All things Lanie already knew. She just needed silence. Lanie figured in a graveyard, she could easily achieve that. But not any gravestone would do, she couldn’t just hunker down beside the Greenes, or the Temelltons, it needed to be her. It needed to be.\\r\\n“I didn’t come here to search for you! I came here to be with you!” She sniffled. “Just send me a sign! Show me where I’m supposed to go!” She collapsed herself against a tree and shrivelled down to sitting position. Drawing her knees to her chest, she wrapped her arms around, tucking them beneath her chin. She looked around, helpless. She didn’t come here to feel helpless. She felt this already, this emptiness. Nothing went as planned. She came here to relax, to let go, to cry. Not the tears of being lost, but tears to release all this anger she’d bottled inside her.\\r\\nSafety. That’s what Lanie came here for. She wanted to feel safe, for once. She needed to feel the burdens she carried, be lifted, if only for a few moments. It was so much more, she came for so much more. She needed a place, where she could be herself. A place where she could unwind, after a stressful day, and just be the person she was trying so desperately to become. Whoever that was.\\r\\nFinding herself was something Lanie needed to do, and with all these people breathing down her neck, she found it nearly impossible to do so. She was falling apart, piece by piece, she could feel it. They were telling her she was wrong, she was immature, easily pressured, incompetent, untrusting. She was tired of it. Tired of being judged, and constantly watched. She had to cover her tracks, be careful, and watch herself. It became more and more like a fulltime job and she had grown emotionally haggard.\\r\\nShe pulled her music player out, and plugged it into her ears to drown out the silence that had suddenly started to scream at her. She closed her eyes and leaned her head back to rest on the tree trunk. She inhaled deeply, and released a shaky breath.\\r\\nMusic was supposed to sooth her, it was supposed to heal her. She could feel her throat close up, and the welling of tears began. Fighting them back, she swallowed them down. She would not cry anymore, she could not.\\r\\nShe pulled the ear buds forcefully from her ears. The silence had turned deafening, and music could not protect her. Thoughts of her family gushed into her mind. She had let them down, again. She had let her friends down; she probably had even let herself down. Living up to people’s standards was exhausting, and time consuming.\\r\\nLanie pushed herself up from the ground and resumed talking to herself and the silence she needed to escape\\r\\n“I didn’t know you. I never even met you. They tell me I met you, and I was happy with you. But I was a baby, and I don’t remember. You were there for everyone else before me, why couldn’t you be there for me?” Tears rolled down her cheeks in an unsynchronized rhythm. “I need you now, and you’re not here. You’re supposed to be here, right here, I remember. I’ve visited you. Why aren’t you where I remember! You can be here for me, I need you to be here for me now.” She wiped at her nose with the backside of her hand. “Please,” she barely whispered. “Please be here. Let me find you.”\\r\\nIn the midst of her outburst, Lanie had ambled over the gravel path to another patch of headstones. She stopped, looking about her, she sighed. Looking down, she saw it. The name, carved perfectly in the sunken headstone. She fell on all fours and pressed her hand to the name. “Thank you.” She sobbed. “Thank you so much.”\\r\\nHer tears were no longer of anger, and abandonment, but of happiness, and a sense of accomplishment. She had scoured this place, for something that wasn’t where she had thought it was. She had felt as lost here, as she did in her own life. She’d felt helpless, in a place where all she wanted to feel was hope, and a sense of security.\\r\\nMaybe the search for the headstone was what Lanie needed. She needed to look where she shouldn’t, in order to open her eyes. To see something about her life that she hadn’t been able to see till now. She was looking for happiness, and solitude in her life in all the wrong places. She needed to look elsewhere, to family, to friends, to the people she knew were doing everything she despised, just to help her. The lady beneath the headstone had helped her in her path to self-discovery before Lanie had even found her.\\r\\n“I found you,” Lanie breathed. Perhaps in addition to, she’d just found a ray of hope for herself.\\r\\nRolling over to fall on her back, Lanie smiled. For the first time that evening, she smiled. An uncontrollable laughter erupted from her lungs, and she could feel the pieces of her shattered life start to make their way back to each other. Her healing had begun.

It was no surprise that, when her father died, she announced we’d be converting my only place of escape into a suite for her mother. Separate from the house, the space over our two-car garage would be perfect: it was plumbed, had heat, A/C, satellite TV. It was perfect – for me. Melissa didn’t see it that way.\\r\\n“My father loved that room and you know he wanted mom to live with us when he died.”\\r\\n“He wouldn’t want her living in the man-cave!”\\r\\n“Ugh. Your man-cave…there’s nowhere else.” That was the end of the argument.\\r\\nTo convert the space into an apartment meant adding two walls and razing the bar – my beautiful, perfectly designed, one-of-a-kind bar. Demolition was miserable. Waves of grief wracked me with every swing of the sledgehammer. I pleaded with God, with my deceased father-in-law, with any invisible power: please, take this burden from me!\\r\\nUnknown to me until I’d opened it with the sledge, the wall on which I’d built the backsplash for the bar counter wasn’t structural – it floated six inches from the framing of the outside wall of the garage. The space was curious, but the door I exposed in the outside wall was just senseless. The doorknob had a Batman emblem etched into it. It turned easily. Swinging silently out onto the landing of a dark, narrow stairwell, the door seemed somehow more and less impossible.\r\n<!--more-->\\r\\nWindows lined the wall from which the door swung. I opened one and stuck my head out to look at the outside wall of the garage. The vinyl siding was uninterrupted across the place the door opened. Pulling my head back inside, I looked at the gaping door; it clearly opened to enclosed space and gloomy stairs. I slapped myself. It stung.\\r\\nShaking my head to clear it, I stood at the open door. My fingers groped unsuccessfully for a light switch in the landing. I retrieved a flashlight from one of the remaining bar drawers, flicked it on, and pointed it into the stairwell.\\r\\nThe boards creaked as I stepped out the landing. Light washed the treads and walls and flowed down the stairs into the murk. Refreshing and cool, the air contradicted my presumption that the space would be musty. I breathed the crisp air, and a smile replaced the frown I’d been wearing for two days. A new space, an even better man-cave. No…a lair! Testing each step, I slipped into the darkness.\\r\\nThe sheer blackness at the bottom of the stairs prevented me from evaluating the space, and my light failed to penetrate the pitch – refused to illuminate anything. I hit the flashlight’s switch a few times and turned the glowing end to my face. It was on, but the light would not shine past its lens.\\r\\n“Unbelievable, right?”\\r\\nI jumped, spun, flailed my arms. “Who’s there?”\\r\\n“I mean, when was the last time you could see light but couldn’t use it to see anything else?”\\r\\n“Who’s there? I…” I trailed off. He was right. How could I see the light but not anything with it? “How did you get in here? Is there another door?”\\r\\n“I’ve always been here. It’s about time you built a door.”\\r\\n“What? I didn’t build that door. Who are you?”\\r\\n“You still can’t tell?” He clicked his tongue, “I’m disappointed.”\\r\\n“Do I know you? Am I getting punked?” I swung the flashlight through the air and stepped in circles.\r\n“Settle down; you’re not going to find anything. This is a big place, but there’s nothing in it yet.”\r\n“There’s you.”\\r\\n“I’m just a voice. And, some damn good ideas.”\\r\\n“Getting out of my house would be a damn good idea.”\\r\\nThe voice laughed, and its familiarity surprised me.\\r\\n“Unfortunately, I’m stuck here. But, since you’re keeping me here, it’s time you might as well use me. After all, this is your lair.” His voice was so much like my own.\\r\\n“Right,” I reasoned, hoping to draw out him out, “My lair. And I need it because I’m losing my man cave.”\\r\\n“Only temporarily. But, we need a place to plan once that bitch moves in.”\\r\\n“How do you know about that?”\\r\\n“Really?” He huffed. “Focus!

A lot.\\r\\nMum has an affair and dad gets a promotion. Dad takes his friend Jack Daniels for a drive but doesn''t see the Stop sign, the red light, or the oncoming car. No seatbelt; no chance. Kills himself and takes three others with him. Small funeral; few friends; fewer tears. Mum cries, but only just.\\r\\nHer lover moves in two months later. He''s a jerk but mum loves him. He touches Helen, so Tony knocks him out. Mum shouts and screams then marries the jerk. Tony loses his virginity at sixteen. Messy, awkward, no condom, but you can''t make a baby the first time. School exams. Not enough study but he passes. He wants to be a lawyer. Helen is bullied at school so he fights.\\r\\nHe is tougher now so he gives better than he gets. Step-dad cheats once, twice, maybe more. Mum gets wise and tells him to leave.\\r\\nMore exams. Still not enough study. Fails a couple. First real girlfriend at seventeen. Emma. Mum says she''s a bad influence. Helen agrees. Emma smokes dope and likes to experiment. Tony refuses to join in, but only at first. A few joints, then a couple of tablets, then a line or two. He doesn''t really like it but after a while it doesn''t seem to matter. Emma takes heroin but Tony draws the line there. They split after seven months. Mum says good riddance.\\r\\nHe gets into studying and passes both his re-sits. He is accepted into university a week before he turns eighteen. A man now but he still doesn''t drink because his dad was an asshole when he did. He has sex a few more times with a few more women. One night stands. University starts. A new beginning. New friends. He spends many nights studying and being good, but many more being bad. The police question him about a stolen car, but he is innocent, then about a burglary. He lies and says he knows nothing. The wrong crowd. It happens.\\r\\nHe takes driving lessons, passes, and buys a small car on interest free terms. He meets a girl in the library, gets to know her, gets her pregnant.\\r\\nHer name is Denise and because he believes in doing it properly, her last name is soon the same as his. He leaves university and two months later his daughter is born. She is perfect. Ten fingers and ten toes.\\r\\nHe gets a factory job. It''s not great but it pays the bills. He argues with Denise. They fight about money, about freedom, about most things. His daughter is sick, and suddenly his daughter is dead. Just like that. Cot death they call it. The tragedy brings them closer. Denise tries to take her own life but Tony walks into the bathroom before she puts the blade to her wrist. The doctor says she is depressed and gives her some pills.\\r\\nTony wants another child but it''s too soon. He bumps into a friend he hasn''t seen for ten years. Still the same, only older. They catch up then go their separate ways. People move on. It''s the way it goes. He celebrates one, two, three years of marriage. His mum has a heart attack but she is soon back on her feet. Close call, nonetheless. Helen gets married but gets a divorce soon after. Easy come, easy go.\\r\\nTony and Denise move into the country to get away from the memories, but the one thing you can''t run away from is yourself. Life gets better, as it sometimes does. His wife is smiling again, his mum is strong again, and his sister is engaged again. It''s for real this time, she assures him.\\r\\nTony finds a job with more money and less hours, and soon he and Denise are thinking about starting a family. Again. Denise is scared at first but cries with happiness when the test is positive.\\r\\nHe comes home from work at the same time every day, but today he leaves early because his wife is in labour. He drives to the hospital a little faster than he should. A little too fast. The road is wet but he takes his chances anyway. He tries to brake, tries to turn, but hits the tree square.\\r\\nNo seatbelt, just like dad. No chance either. What goes around, comes around.\\r\\nSplashed on the bonnet. Blood everywhere. His whole life flashing before him. Twenty five years in a heartbeat. Lub-dup. All the ups, downs, and in-betweens. Triumph and tragedy, side by side. Tony thinks about Denise, and hopes this time it''s a boy.\\r\\nHe knows that when he closes his eyes it will be for the last time.\\r\\nSo he does.\\r\\nAnd it is.

Twelve feet tall.\\r\\nI was watching a program on the history channel the other night and a gentleman was showing his magnificent collection of antique guns and swords. He was most proud of a sword from the 19th century that had been made for a man described as “a lighthouse among lamp posts.” The sword was so long that the six foot tall collector couldn’t unsheathe it in one pull. It had belonged to a Kentuckian that was seven feet, nine inches tall. I would very much like to have been that man’s friend.\\r\\nI am a non-hugger and I come from a long line of non-huggers. Growing up, I think the hugging stopped when I was five or six years old. Today, when I visit my mother, we hug, but I have to tell you, she’s so tiny and frail that I’m afraid to hug her with much enthusiasm. I find it very unsatisfying as hugs go, and I don’t think she gets much out of it either.\\r\\nWhen I was very young I used to love her hugs She’d stoop down, wrap both arms around my waist, and hoist me up with a dramatic groan. Then she’d slip an arm under my bottom and I’d fall into her, my tiny, chubby arms around her neck and my face buried into the top of her cotton dress. I have a sense of that memory at least. Maybe more like a memory of a memory, but complete with the smell of her perfume and the warmth of her skin.\\r\\nMy father was, even by grownup standards, a mountain of a man. He was almost six feet tall and well over 200 pounds, wooly and musky, thunderous and jolly. His hugs I do remember directly. He’d stick his huge hands in the pits of my arms and in one effortless move toss me straight up like a rocket, and then catch me with his arms wrapped around my legs on the way down. My belly was always bare and he’d munch and growl and scratch me with his stubbly beard and I’d howl with delight. He laughed so freely and hugged so well. I think he hugged me for several years after my mother stopped.\\r\\nWhat I miss the most about my father’s hugs is the way he smelled. It was a musky, smoky...well, manly smell. It has always been for me the manly smell. I have the same smell, but I rarely catch the odor on myself. Sometimes, in the car on the way to work, I’ll light a cigarette and just for one breath, I’ll catch it: My father’s smell. It’s not just the cigarette. It’s something more. It’s the way the smoke blends with my natural odor and it always makes me think of him. And it always makes me miss him.\\r\\nIt’s been many years since I had a satisfying hug like dad’s. That’s why I wish there were giants.\\r\\nLike that Kentuckian. Men and women of such height and strength that they can take adults like me and hug us like little children. A man about twelve feet tall and stocky, unshaven and wearing a flannel shirt. He could toss me up and plop me down on his knee facing him, bounce me around a while and make me giggle. “Ride ‘em horsie, down-town. Look out, little boy, you fall doooooown!” He’d grab my wrists and fling me backwards until the top of my head bumped gently on the floor, and I’d giggle wildly. I don’t giggle enough these days. Then he’d pull me into a great smothering hug and I’d just grin and breathe in the manly smell.\\r\\nA woman, ten feet tall and full-bosomed, wearing a cotton dress, could pull me to her with soft, flabby arms. She could put one hand on the back of my head and push my face into her neck. Her long, full hair could cascade across my face and tickle my nose as I nuzzle in and she could sing in a whisper some old song about her baby boy. And I could close my eyes and go to sleep, completely surrounded by security and love; safe at last. I’d pay good money to sleep like that again.\\r\\nI’ve never been afraid of giants. The giants I knew in my youth always made me feel special. They always made me feel loved and protected. The giants of my youth, now, as much as then, still make me giggle.

He had been sitting there all day in front of the computer, pretending to do other things, putting off actually having to be creative. Which was strange considering, the thing he desired most was to be truly creative.\\r\\nThe problem wasn''t so much a lack of decent ideas and experience to draw from, but more the ability to cleanly extract just one of those ideas at a time. Perish the notion of actually organizing the cacophony of thoughts and images in his head into some sort of coherent story.\\r\\nHis thoughts were a very close-knit and protective herd.  If he managed to pluck one, it wasn''t long before the pack came to its rescue.  Once in a blue moon he was able to escape to the damp dark confines of his cave with one or two of the herds weaker thoughts firmly in his grasp.\\r\\nThen came the problem of how best to prepare these freshly bagged ideas.  Maybe it''s best to sink his teeth in to the raw fresh flesh, and quickly enjoy the guttural pleasures of the fresh kill.  He could slowly roast them over an open fire, so he could enjoy the warmth and taste nuances, which that method would provide.  Or, even better yet, he could preserve them; store the precious ideas for another day. Unfortunately, his struggle with the process - deciding what he will do with his newly acquired thoughts - often lasts well after the ideas have rotted away to nothing.\\r\\nOver-analysis was his stumbling block - well actually more of an Everest like mountain.  Of course plenty of people had scaled the sides of that mighty mountain, but he was quite certain that none of them were wearing sandals, cargo shorts, and a T-shirt at the time.  Every sentence, even every word for that matter, was scrutinized as though the fate of the world depended on its meaning.  If only he could equip himself to climb this gargantuan peak.\\r\\nThe correct tools seemed to be what he was lacking. Or maybe he had all the tools right there at his disposal but the prospect of figuring out how to correctly use them was proving to be too daunting of a task.  Either way, procrastination, and slacking seemed to be so much more pleasurable, at least until the bills starting rolling in, and reality was beating him about the face.\\r\\nBut, what is reality?  Aren''t writers in the business of helping people step out of reality, even if just for a moment?  A hiatus from reality isn''t found only in the fictitious world of a novel, it can be found in almost every bit of writing.  After all when you read the news of some far away place about something that is happening to people you don''t know, is that truly real?  Are you not, in a way taken, by your mind, to that place?  If you can''t see it, feel it, smell it, then how can it be real?  Hell, even things you can wrap your senses around don''t always feel real.  Does the nature - or rather the perception - of reality make the writer''s job easier or harder?  How can these questions even be asked in a world of uncertain realities?\\r\\nThese were all things that raced through his mind, as he enjoyed the sensory pleasure of picking at a scab on his arm.\\r\\nOh, what the hell!  He had just spent 5 minutes picking at a scab, that his fiance had been telling him to leave alone for weeks.  He always told her that he was certain, if he picked the scab, it would heal better.  He knew that was not true, at least not now that he was getting older.  But, it did give him a reason to not have to strain his brain trying to get those rambunctious thoughts all in a nice neat line.\\r\\nHe wondered if the problem wasn''t so much getting the thoughts out and on paper, but figuring out how to tie them all up with a pretty bow.\\r\\nHe thought it particularly fitting and even amusing that he couldn''t even get through a story about not being able to get through a story.\\r\\nWho ordered the irony? \\r\\nI need a smoke, Bob said to himself.\r\n', 'Thought Wrangling by Robert Bradeen', 0, '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '43-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-09-15 09:05:55', '2016-09-15 17:05:55', '', 43, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/43-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I understand that you have these thoughts because you, unlike me, have not experienced this kiss.  I could continue to describe the empty slate of my mind as those lips broke contact, but I will not.  I know you would not believe it.  I will only tell you how it was when I came back.  When I joined the ranks of the living.  My eyes were closed and I did not see him leave but I felt it.  I heard the slow creak of the door accompanied by a slightly louder noise of the wood hitting against the door frame as it closed.  I wriggled a little, feeling the rough soles of my feet hit the smooth skin on the top and stopped.  An alien layer lay between that contact like some impermeable membrane and I was conscious of not being able to reach myself.  My hands slid all over myself, feeling the smoothness of legs and the fabric of the nightgown and the warmth underneath.  My hands moved under the fabric and I expected to feel a familiar sense of pleasure, a rush of blood to the surface capillaries.  But I only felt again the unfamiliar layer of separation.  I tried again with a mounting desperation, first caressing then hurting.  I was pinching the skin like a doctor would a victim of paralysis.  Nothing.\\r\\nSo you see, it was the kiss.  The kiss allowed me to traverse into the world beyond the one you inhabit.  It allowed my long alien fingers to touch the keyboard with rhythm and grace as I write this.  My dear reader, neither am I dead nor am I crazy.  I tell you that I will go on.  Will experience many more kisses, many more intimate moments; meet many more men with a gleam in their eyes.  But I will no longer know this keening, this desire that consumes.  I am settled now and I am sitting up the bed, covers curled over my legs, unable to stop the flow of words from my mind to my fingertips.  How, you are thinking, was he able to cause this change?  You are picturing Adonis, and you are shivering.  You are picturing a god and you too want him.  You are blushing now, so I will correct you.  He is not a perfect man, is not the man I will marry or grow old with.  What then, is he?  He is a man.  He is a man caught up in the journey of becoming whole, not quite handsome, but perfect for me.  And that is it.  That is what I have been trying to tell you.  As he left I realized that he was perfect for me.  You are shrinking now, thinking of putting down this paper, feeling embarrassed for me and a bit disgusted for buying into my fiction.  Because you did believe, my dearest reader, my friend.  You had closed your eyes and vanished into the deepest part of yourself searching, reaching for a similar kiss.  But what now?  You are telling me of your own heartbreak, your own perfect men, and what am I doing?  I am turning away and I am closing my eyes and I am dreaming of the last kiss with the perfect man on a narrow bed in a room with whitewashed walls.

(554, 1, '2016-09-28 09:11:18', '2016-09-28 17:11:18', 'Things were so very, very different. I was so much more than three years and thirteen days younger. I was a decade younger, perhaps two, neck-deep in a world of money, privilege, international travel and blissful ignorance of so many things. My older brother was invincible, good at everything, impeccable in every way. He was what we all wanted to be, an example forever shining before us. Sometimes I wanted to kick him in the shins, for being so impossible to stack up next to. No matter how hard I trained, how many hours I sunk into my sailing, into anything - he would always come out on top, graceful and un-phased. As if it were all nothing, nothing at all.\\r\\nI used to watch him win races, watch his easy courage and innate skill. Watch with such a complicated mix of loathing, jealousy, awe, respect, and a deep love of who he was, what he did, and how he did it. Case never spoke an ill word to a competitor. He did not hold his sportsmanship haughtily above others, no... He never made anyone feel bad for a bit of smack talk. In fact, he always enjoyed it - would smile a bit out of the corner of his mouth and even laugh from time to time. But he never added to the pile. Ever. He never needed to put anyone beneath him. In fact, I think he wanted them right beside him, so he could beat his equals, not his lessers.\\r\\nEverything for Case is, at its core, a competition with himself and no one else. Sure, he is competitive as they come, but when it comes down to it, it is so much more than a quest for recognition or trophies or money or sponsorship. Part of that is the luxury of our family, our stability, our ability not to worry about the monetary stresses of ''real life'' and just do what we do. But most of it? It is who Case is.\\r\\nWhen everything went up in smoke and spray on May 18th, 2004, his competitive goals simply shifted. Now, it certainly had nothing to do with the hull beside him. Now, it was truly my brother versus himself. Versus the parts of him that no longer seemed his own - the cancer, the injuries, the pain, the inability to turn to training to get him through. No, there was nothing for Case to turn to. There was no handbook, no trick of the trade, no secret. He simply had to get down in the work and take it as it came. No one is better suited for that task than my brother.\\r\\nWe watched him trade punches with the sudden shoddy hand he was dealt. We watched him hit the floor, gasping for wind, so many times. We learned he was not immortal, that he was breakable, just like everyone else. How? How could he be like everyone else? He had never been like everyone else so long as he had lived. It was unsettling, unspeakably difficult, unspeakably surreal. And yet, there it was, in painful black and white before us every day as the colour drained from his face, as his muscles left him and the day to day became nearly insurmountable for him. He lost everything, everything, everything. Everything but his life. And, he has shown, that that was all he needed to hold on to to be able to rise again.\\r\\nSometimes, I see him now, and realize he is more himself, three years later, than he ever was.\\r\\nCase was not the only one to go up in smoke that day. The woman he loved went up as well, with Marty and I beside her. Marty and I came back, only to watch Alex falter and nearly fall - we held our breath as he climbed back from hell, ever so slowly. Callie fell, and we could not catch her, try as we might.\\r\\nSince then, we have risen. A bit worn for the voyage, more than a bit worse for wear. We bring with us evidence of the past, reminders that will haunt tired muscles and aching bones for years to come. But most of all, we bring a bit of wisdom. A bit of understanding that may be beyond our years, but has been a long time coming regardless.\\r\\nHere we are, three years later. With Case strong, tall, and silent beside us. Just the way he has always been. And now, we are back to the frivolous games. We are back to teasing, and betting, and taunting a bit to get the other to bite. Whether it be a friendly race around the buoys, an afternoon of chemo, poker, surgery, physical therapy, or pool: we are all in.', 'Three Years by Katya AaltoTanssija', 0, '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '60-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-09-28 09:11:18', '2016-09-28 17:11:18', '', 60, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/60-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

During the previous sixteen hours, he had painstakingly replaced the elevator motor, repaired damage done to the elevator shed by a recent ice floe, bored a four foot hole into the surface, and made some repairs to the deteriorating survey equipment.\\r\\nWithout a doubt, John was emotionally and physically exhausted when his wife sat a container of broth in front of him. He thought back to the hole he had made and filled on the surface. Two of the drill augers were ruined during the project. When the second one broke in the rigid ice, he had lost his temper, stepped down into the swallow recess he had cut into the surface, and violently attacked the frozen walls with an ice axe. Once the hole was filled, he hammered a couple rovers back into functionality. This had helped him release some of his anger and frustration before going back down to the dormitory.\\r\\nJohn didn’t say anything to his family as he drank the broth.

The younger child, seated next to his brother, looked down at his container and started to cry\\r\\nThere were a few minutes of silence, aside from the younger boy’s sobs, before anyone spoke again.\\r\\nFinishing the broth, John thought that he might also start to cry. He was certain he could feel that sorrowful pressure building up in his eyes.\\r\\n“Okay,” he finally said, “let’s go up.”\\r\\nHis two boys carefully dressed themselves with his wife’s help. Suits were fastened into place, helmets were sealed, special boots were strapped on feet, oxygen cylinders were connected, and radio transmitters were tested.\\r\\n“Can you hear me?” his younger son asked through the transmitter from the other side of the dormitory.\\r\\n“Yes, I can.”\\r\\nHis wife didn’t want to go to the surface yet. He didn’t really want to go back up either, but he knew that his sons had most likely been waiting the entire day to see the result of his labor.\\r\\nBefore leaving the dormitory, the older boy picked up a hammer from the work room and a scrap piece of ice-damaged aluminum that had been part of the elevator shed.\\r\\nOnce in the elevator, John let the younger boy push the large black button. The door sealed, the new motor hummed to life, and the car started the long crawl upward.\\r\\nWhen the door opened again, a mottled landscape of creamy white with black patches was revealed.\\r\\nJohn stepped out first, and his sons followed. Charon hung low in the black sky, surrounded by thousands of white stars. Crunching through methane frost, the boys could see that their father had not lied. A recent cryovolcanic eruption had been especially forceful, disturbing the area surrounding the elevator shed entrance. Newly formed chaos terrain, a patchwork of white, black, red, and ruddy orange, stretched off toward the horizon.\\r\\nThe boys stopped momentarily to observe the sun, which shined only a dim light through Pluto’s hazy atmosphere. John marched the boys onward a few more meters.\\r\\nEventually, the trio came to a circular depression in the ice. This was the hole John had bored earlier that day.\\r\\n“This is it,” John said in a voice hardly more than a whisper. He wasn’t even certain that the sound had been captured by the transmitter.\\r\\nThe boys stood still for a moment, with the younger of the two occasionally looking back toward the sun.\\r\\n“Will she get to heaven from here?” the younger boy’s voice crackled across the transmitter’s speaker.\\r\\n“Yes,” John said after a pause, “if anything, we might actually be closer to heaven out here.”\\r\\nHe and his sons stood over five billion kilometers from Earth. John wanted to comfort his sons by saying that their family was actually five billion kilometers closer to heaven, but frowned when he remembered Pluto was the ruler of the underworld.\\r\\n“She always told me how warm the sun was on Earth,” the younger boy said, “I hope she is finally warm again now.”\\r\\nThe irony in his younger son’s statement cut through John Jurrjens as he looked down at the depression in the ice. The body of his daughter was wedged four feet down into this freezing hole, which he later filled with ice and snow. His wife thought that burial on the surface was the right decision, especially since there had been no recent communication from Earth.\\r\\nHis older son dropped down to his knees and placed the scrap aluminum over the jumbled ice crystals that filled the hole.

Newly formed chaos terrain, a patchwork of white, black, red, and ruddy orange, stretched off toward the horizon.\r\n            The boys stopped momentarily to observe the sun, which shined only a dim light through Pluto’s hazy atmosphere. John marched the boys onward a few more meters.\r\nEventually, the trio came to a circular depression in the ice. This was the hole John had bored earlier that day.\r\n            “This is it,” John said in a voice hardly more than a whisper. He wasn’t even certain that the sound had been captured by the transmitter.\r\n            The boys stood still for a moment, with the younger of the two occasionally looking back toward the sun.\r\n            “Will she get to heaven from here?” the younger boy’s voice crackled across the transmitter’s speaker.\r\n            “Yes,” John said after a pause, “if anything, we might actually be closer to heaven out here.”\r\nHe and his sons stood over five billion kilometers from Earth. John wanted to comfort his sons by saying that their family was actually five billion kilometers closer to heaven, but frowned when he remembered Pluto was the ruler of the underworld.\r\n            “She always told me how warm the sun was on Earth,” the younger boy said, “I hope she is finally warm again now.”\r\n            The irony in his younger son’s statement cut through John Jurrjens as he looked down at the depression in the ice. The body of his daughter was wedged four feet down into this freezing hole, which he later filled with ice and snow. His wife thought that burial on the surface was the right decision, especially since there had been no recent communication from Earth.\r\n            His older son dropped down to his knees and placed the scrap aluminum over the jumbled ice crystals that filled the hole. The boy used the hammer to carefully pound the aluminum into the ice. He could see that his older son had fashioned the scrap aluminum into a cross.\r\n            John stood with his sons on the ice near the grave. He lifted his gaze out passed Charon, the ferryman of the dead, and toward where he imaged Earth must be careening through space.\r\n            He looked down to the cross one last time. Five billion kilometers closer to heaven or not, he knew God would not forget about the Jurrjens family. John put an arm around each boy and prepared to turn his sons toward the elevator shed.\r\n            Until he made contact with Earth again, he didn’t want either child on the surface for too long. He only had one auger left.

(639, 1, '2016-10-05 15:37:07', '2016-10-05 23:37:07', 'Somehow or other ten years had gone by and she lost her voice. Her name, Orpha, was the last word she ever spoke out loud. Spoken in a whisper, it sounded like Alpha, a promising beginning. But perhaps creation, once it has been opened with Alpha, can only be followed by silence.\\r\\nSitting in her chair on the porch she watched the empty parked cars. Frost scribbled on the windows and a small after-image froze: her fingers dangled in the air after she crossed herself three times. She often said to herself: I am the only one here.\\r\\nMuch earlier in her life (she had come over mountains and the ocean), she had seen rivers that looked like small streams, cities at night that flashed and were gone. Then she fell from above, and crashed, and ever since then she was in a flat country she never understood.\\r\\nShe would think to herself: It’s only when I’m sleeping that I never say “I’m dreaming.”\\r\\nThere were places out of time that all flowed into different corners of the halls. For instance, her husband Charles reading the Iliad in the yellow chair by the plastic potted ferns. Or a rubbed-out message in chalk that was blowing over the tire prints in the oval gravel drive.\\r\\nBut when she dreamed, she was always the same age she is now.\\r\\nWhen a hand appeared, a face, or a voice was heard from staff or visitors, everything changed: the black dog’s paws clicked across the porch, then came the tail eagerly slapping the floor: ear-dreams.\\r\\nOrpha on the porch, waving her arms, as if she were imitating the movements of the leaves,  or  saying goodbye to someone, or hailing one of the parked cars. She had angry, comprehending eyes. Palms up, she felt strong, and with her eyes closed she could believe the sunlight that settled upon her was warm fur. Those moments reminded her of nothing but: I AM.\\r\\nOnce, it streamed everywhere, and she was present, joined to one place. Those friendly and curious hands cupped the immense realm beyond the mountains: the edge of a continent. Death for once was all on the surface – the waves took it away. And she existed as skin, hunger, love: I AM, I AM. She smiled, but the eyes in her dream still looked angry. “Why am I here?” she asked herself. “Why am I here?” When she awoke, she was making motions with her fingers as if she were threading a needle.\\r\\n“Those jerks and jabs with her fingers mimic the speech of someone who stutters,” said the doctor examining her. “Was she a stutterer?”\\r\\n“The black dog knows,” she heard.\\r\\nNurse Jane was panting over her, her face contracted in one firm, set expression. She wanted to shout: “I know words. But do you? No, but you say you do. And that, dear Nurse Jane, that is the broken promise of speech: you think you are using words, but the words are using you.”\\r\\nThey carried her to a freshly made bed. It was a new room. Doctor’s orders. She heard him say the word change and out of his mouth chattered something like tumbling coins. (To whom had thoughts ever been so palpable?).\\r\\n“Put me out in the forest,” she wanted to say. “Lay me down among the sticks and the rotting leaves.“\\r\\nThe doctor: “Did she say something?”\\r\\nNurse Jane: “Orpha, did you say something?”\\r\\nI’m the log in the forest that will become the Savior. I’m the sculptor carving the log in the forest that will become the Savior. I’m the carpenter nailing the Savior to the post.\\r\\nThe wind made a sound like an animal squishing through wet leaves. Then the animal was gone, too.\\r\\nBut by and by the sliver of light under the door became a thin white bone. A drawer being opened was a short bark. The came the click of nails on the floor and the eager panting, panting, which in the ear-dream again became the ticking of the clock.\\r\\nTicking, ticking.\\r\\nAnguish.\\r\\nAnguish, passing from dark to dark and eyes lying in wait for the light.\\r\\nHer neighbor in the next bed was again busy counting, one thousand three, one thousand four, but this time Orpha’s pulse didn’t race to catch up. A single sound was repeated over and over – not a word, not yet a word, but something like “hmm?” blown through cupped hands.\\r\\nNurse Jane turning to her surprised, said: “If you don’t acknowledge this small miracle now, Orpha, you’ll be mute forever.”\\r\\n“Yes, yes, “ Orpha nodded, chomping on her teeth, as though the words, her first spoken words in ten years, didn’t really fit her right.\\r\\n“I want to say something that can be heard long after I’ve finished speaking,” said Orpha.\\r\\nNurse June clapped her hands. “Say it! What will it be?”\\r\\n “Listen,” said Orpha, nearly shouting. “If the Lord really has words for it, this is it.”\\r\\n “Yes? Yes? Tell me. “ Nurse Jane bent over her. What is it?”\\r\\n“Listen:”\\r\\n<strong>(For Orpha Buchart, 1889-1992) </strong>', 'Being Orpha by Josepha Gutelius', 0, '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '221-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-10-05 15:37:07', '2016-10-05 23:37:07', '', 221, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/221-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(589, 1, '2016-09-29 10:50:58', '2016-09-29 18:50:58', 'It was reasonably late in my life that I discovered there was a name for my fear of crowded places. And more specifically, the term agoraphobia, upon stumbling over it recently in my Spanish-English dictionary, gave validity to what my family had always considered a silly and embarrassingly illogical concern.\\r\\nAgoraphobia- Fear of crowded, public places like markets (or in my case, beaches). \\r\\nI was fortunate enough as a child to entertain wild and dreamy ideas when it came to planning holiday vacations. When asked where this year''s Christmas break should be spent with my brother and parents, I''d regularly contemplate the most recent grand prize Bob Barker had given away on The Price Is Right. \"How about a relaxing tropical escape to luxurious Graaaaand Cayman?\" I''d say, using a cheesy, almost salesy intonation to my voice. Usually no one listened. \\r\\nHoliday breaks allowed us to see new places and experience new things; a sense of novelty that inspired us to let down our guard and, as a country singer might put it, try ''n live a little. Honey coated cereals, for example, not permitted otherwise in our home, were allowed in the mornings of vacations via small cardboard packages that limited our Fruit Loop or Apple Jack consumption to a muted sugar high. We rented convertible jeeps that we wouldn''t be caught dead driving in the States, for their poor safety ratings and we stayed in houses with pools (a huge insurance liability back at home). We went out to exceedingly expensive restaurants that would normally be the butt of our jokes and we wore polo shirts and flower prints that were about as unnatural as the suntans we displayed on our legs and necks.\\r\\nEven as a young child, I enjoyed, in a sophisticated sort of way, using this deviant theme of doing things outside the box, to safeguard my fears. I never liked crowded beaches though I can''t really say why.\\r\\nTo me, the nicest beach in the world meant nothing if there were more than five people on it. It may sound silly, but I always had a tendency to group crowded beaches, no matter their location or quality, together in a list entitled Places I Wouldn''t Be Caught Dead In, accompanied by the likes of Red Lobster and old haunted prison cells. Belize, Phuket, Laguna, Atlantic City: they were all the same to me unless a tsunami was coming and I had the beach to myself. \\r\\nIt was this fear, this anxiety for packed beaches that kept me far inland when we vacationed to coastal regions, but inherently, it also bred a sort of whimsical pursuit: the search or hunt for something secluded and private and rare.\\r\\nVacation mornings with the family were spent, often under my governance, searching for private bays and coves. Usually, when we''d come across something that might qualify, I''d discard it as \"too windy\" or \"not white enough\" secretly concerned about the fat group of Germans hanging out in the shade. They wore tiny spandex-like bathing suits. I was almost compulsive in my need for privacy and to an extent, my parents took this apprehension into account, before occasionally throwing their sandy novels and beach towels on the floor and saying \"enough is enough already!\" \\r\\nUpon coming across a vacation spot we liked (and coincidentally one which had great secluded beaches), my family enjoyed returning the next year for round two, and then three, and sometimes then four. The only issue though, was that I''d see, before my very eyes, various beaches-which I once considered my own-being invaded. Quiet nooks in places like St. Martin or Eleuthra or Maine slowly becoming inhabited by tourists, whom I''d pass with outraged eyes as if to say, we got here first you know.\\r\\nTo an extent, this natural evolution and crowding of my favorite private beaches of the world made me nauseous. But it was with great, almost poetic timing, that Panama came into my life and offered up an entire new gamut of options. \\r\\nUpon first sight, it was the feeling I imagine an antique collector might enjoy upon walking into an exceptional flea market: a sense of excitement and restlessness: that you want to see everything and go everywhere and you want to do it all at once before anyone else can. I got my first kicks a few years back on the shores of Isla Canas (Los Santos) and San Blas (Kuna Yala), where beaches were about as deserted as my fifth grade piano recitals. I took comfort in looking up and down coastlines and seeing nothing for miles, a kind of panacea for my newly-diagnosed beach agoraphobia. \\r\\nI relished the opportunity to dig my toes into the warm sands of Santa Clara (Cocle) and Red Frog Beach (Bocas del Toro) with no one around and I have no doubt that the ability to do so has subconsciously kept me in Panama ever since. But like any secret, some chatty folks will eventually spread the word and the very isolation that made them so attractive at the beginning will evaporate like an aerosol room freshener, into thin air. \\r\\nIn reality I can''t really blame them nor can I claim to be the first pioneer as there may very well have been some neurotics before me in this quest. But because Panama is so relatively untouched, there still exist a number of secluded beaches to explore. And for that, the beach hunter in me carries on. \\r\\n<em>Matt Landau is the founder of <a href=\"http://www.thepanamareport.com\"> The Panama Report</a>.

He walked like poetry, the slow grace of his movements rushing through her until all she could do was gasp.  Delete.  He sat on the porch, cheeks stained with tears, and the slow progression of time was marked only by the call of the birds in the trees.  Delete.  He walked out the door, as I stopped running and looked at him in the semi-darkness.  Delete.  He kissed me softly as I sunk into the softness of the bed, feeling it strain as I slowly gave in.  When he kissed me, I thought “Capture this”.  Take a picture.  Run the video camera.  I want to hold onto it.   When he kissed me I knew it was the last.\\r\\nSo I write this to you, unnamed reader, so that I will not forget.  So that I remember.  This is how it happened.  I am seeing him now and I see his Adam’s apple, sharply protruding from his neck, moving closer as the clock makes one excruciatingly long tick toward the next second.  And then his lips are on mine.  Have I told you that his lips are full, round sensuous against a visage shaped like stone?  Those lips, dear reader, are meant for sin.  You don’t believe me, you are laughing; but it is true.  Then his lips are on mine, lightly pressing against my mouth and I want to arch into it and I want to pull him down to me until I don’t know where I end and he begins.  You must think that this is not so special.  You must be thinking, I have had such kisses in my lifetime.  But you are wrong.  I was being kissed and I was no longer there.  I heard the rush of soft rain on the tree outside my window and the insistent scurry of two squirrels cavorting.  But I no longer felt my heart beat and my blood pulse or the tears coursing down my cheeks.  I no longer felt the uncomfortable warmth of the layers of blankets covering my body.   For that moment, I did not exist.\\r\\nStill you say, my most skeptical reader, that I just didn’t perceive those things.  That I did not perceive the wind from the window or the smooth fabric on my skin but I knew that they existed, that there was more to the moment than the tale I am recounting.  I understand that you have these thoughts because you, unlike me, have not experienced this kiss.  I could continue to describe the empty slate of my mind as those lips broke contact, but I will not.  I know you would not believe it.  I will only tell you how it was when I came back.  When I joined the ranks of the living.  My eyes were closed and I did not see him leave but I felt it.  I heard the slow creak of the door accompanied by a slightly louder noise of the wood hitting against the door frame as it closed.  I wriggled a little, feeling the rough soles of my feet hit the smooth skin on the top and stopped.  An alien layer lay between that contact like some impermeable membrane and I was conscious of not being able to reach myself.  My hands slid all over myself, feeling the smoothness of legs and the fabric of the nightgown and the warmth underneath.  My hands moved under the fabric and I expected to feel a familiar sense of pleasure, a rush of blood to the surface capillaries.  But I only felt again the unfamiliar layer of separation.  I tried again with a mounting desperation, first caressing then hurting.  I was pinching the skin like a doctor would a victim of paralysis.  Nothing.\\r\\nSo you see, it was the kiss.  The kiss allowed me to traverse into the world beyond the one you inhabit.  It allowed my long alien fingers to touch the keyboard with rhythm and grace as I write this.  My dear reader, neither am I dead nor am I crazy.  I tell you that I will go on.  Will experience many more kisses, many more intimate moments; meet many more men with a gleam in their eyes.  But I will no longer know this keening, this desire that consumes.  I am settled now and I am sitting up the bed, covers curled over my legs, unable to stop the flow of words from my mind to my fingertips.  How, you are thinking, was he able to cause this change?  You are picturing Adonis, and you are shivering.  You are picturing a god and you too want him.  You are blushing now, so I will correct you.  He is not a perfect man, is not the man I will marry or grow old with.  What then, is he?  He is a man.  He is a man caught up in the journey of becoming whole, not quite handsome, but perfect for me.  And that is it.  That is what I have been trying to tell you.  As he left I realized that he was perfect for me.  You are shrinking now, thinking of putting down this paper, feeling embarrassed for me and a bit disgusted for buying into my fiction.  Because you did believe, my dearest reader, my friend.  You had closed your eyes and vanished into the deepest part of yourself searching, reaching for a similar kiss.  But what now?  You are telling me of your own heartbreak, your own perfect men, and what am I doing?  I am turning away and I am closing my eyes and I am dreaming of the last kiss with the perfect man on a narrow bed in a room with whitewashed walls.

But since I’m the one writing this essay, I get to do the talking. And I say I want him to disappear. Not forever, just for a week or so. Ten days, maybe. Two weeks?\\r\\nSee, every winter since before Johnny and I met, I’ve visited a friend in California (or Georgia, Florida, Arizona – wherever she happens to be living at the time). And every fall, Johnny’s gone to Ireland to see his mum. But Johnny’s mum died last year, and my friend is in the throes of finishing her PhD. Neither Johnny nor I have anyone to visit and, as he would say, we’ve been living in each other’s ear holes far too long…\\r\\nIs there a reason he can’t shut off a light behind him? Close a door? Or turn on the damn exhaust fan when he takes a shower? Why does he keep asking me what I want for dinner when I haven’t eaten breakfast yet – have I ever one time had an answer? And, speaking of which, if I so much as smell another plate of chicken curry I swear to god I’ll—\\r\\nLook, I love him, but one of us has got to go. \\r\\nI’ve never understood these couples that claim to miss each other when they’re separated for a single night. (You see? “Claim.” I can’t even bring myself to believe them.) They’re always checking in, reporting their activities, counting the hours till they’re back in one another’s arms. Gag me, I don’t get it. Johnny and I need our time apart. If I try to check in with him when I’m away, he doesn’t answer because he’s out with the boys. If he calls me from the road I’ve got the stereo cranked to eleven, enjoying my empty house too much to listen for the phone.\\r\\nWhen we’ve spent too many nights together in a row, I’ve been known to retire at 6:00 just to get some time away; he’ll fall asleep watching TV in the living room and stay there. We just aren’t hip-attachment kind of people. Putting a little space between us once in a while is how we manage to maintain civility for the better part of our domestic lives. \\r\\nA couple thousand miles every six months or so seems to do the trick. But we’re going on a year. I’d actually started weighing the pros and cons of handing Johnny a packed bag and a credit card and dropping him off at the airport like an abandoned puppy (except for, you know, what would a puppy do with a credit card?) – when I remembered about Mick.\\r\\nMickey, a friend of Johnny’s from back home in Dublin, got transferred to Canada a couple months ago and insisted Johnny visit as soon as they were settled in. Assuming they are settled in enough by now to have a visitor – and they must be by now, how long could it take? – then Johnny could be off as soon as I can book a flight! \\r\\nPhew, now maybe I can finally stop this twitching…\\r\\nExcept I just emailed Mick to ask if I could ship my husband to him for a week or so (or maybe longer) in a month or so (or maybe sooner), and Mick wrote back to say don’t book the ticket. The move isn’t working out. His wife is staying in Alberta but Mickey’s going home to Dublin right away. He didn’t say it in so many words, but it sounds like they’ll be getting a divorce. \\r\\nOh. Well. Gosh. It’s none of my business, but… how? This is a couple that’s been together for thirty years. They were in their teens when they got married, they had children very young, but they made it through all that. The kids are grown now. They’re comfortable, financially. If they survived three decades of tribulation back in Dublin, what could possibly have happened (in Canada, no less) to tear them from one another now?\\r\\nI couldn’t bring myself to ask, of course, but Mickey (who always has been generous with his emotions) volunteered. It’s been coming for a while, he writes. Being alone together in a new place simply forced the issue. Neither of them ever had anywhere to go. They’d been living in each other’s ear holes, driving one another nuts. Putting an ocean between them had become the only way to maintain a semblance of civility for the remainder of their respective lives. You know how it is, he wrote. You know?\\r\\nYes. Well, no. I mean, I do, but— \\r\\nThat’s not what I meant when I said one of us had got to go. \\r\\nJohnny and I are lucky, I suppose, that we know this about our relationship. That I can go to bed at six o’clock, he can pass out on the couch, and we can wake up still loving each other in the morning.  Still, though, it’s true I’ve been a little touchy lately. Just because he asks me the same question five times in a row doesn’t mean I have to shout the answer at him. And I could let him watch the SciFi channel sometimes; I don’t have to carp over it every single night. \\r\\nWhen he gets home tonight I’ll have to tell him about Mick, but first I want him to know how much I love him, how glad I am to see him, how proud I am that he’s part of my life. I’ll tell him I missed and thought about him while he was at work, that I was counting down the hours until—\\r\\nNope, I’m gagging. Can’t do it. He’s making me nuts.\\r\\nThink Mickey’ll be ready for a visitor back home in two months? How ’bout three? Seriously, how long could it take?\\r\\n<em>Erin G.

(592, 1, '2016-09-29 13:17:21', '2016-09-29 21:17:21', '“Right mum, we’re off,” said Dylan.\\r\\n“You be careful now. Have you got lunch and all you need?” asked his mum.\\r\\n“Of course we''ve got everything. I’m not five, I’m almost eleven!” replied Dylan.\\r\\n“I know you are but there are still things you need to careful of. There are snakes, giant wasps, eels, water scorpions; even some of the plants are deadly. Whatever you do don’t eat anything. You could die if you do. Watch out for ‘Deadly Nightshade’, there’s enough poison in one of them to kill 500 mice!” she explained.\\r\\n“But we’re not MICE!” exclaimed Dylan.\\r\\n“We know Auntie Joy, and we will be careful. We’ll be back for seven. Don’t worry. We’re not going too far” said Danny.\\r\\n“Remember, you can drown in an inch of water. Just take care of each other” said Joy, concerned. \\r\\nAs long as they could remember Dylan and Danny had always spent their summer holidays together. They were cousins. Their mums were sisters whose husbands had decided to buy a run down farm house in south west France. Every year the families spent their entire summer holidays on a building site. The Dad’s, Bob and Bill, worked relentlessly: mixing concrete; building walls; fitting toilets; laying floors and roofing. You name it, they did it. The Mum’s, Joy and Molly, worked tirelessly as well. In fact what ever the men did they did, apart from digging drains as that was “Men’s work”. This left their children free every day to do exactly what they wanted. Of course they did have jobs, but once these were done they were free to explore the fields and woods that surrounded the farm.\\r\\nIt was late morning and the sun was high in the cloudless sky beating out a relentless heat. The farm was quiet. Most of the birds were sheltering from the sun apart from the swallows that shot through the sky, performing aerobatics the worlds best pilots would be jealous of. The boys set off on their bikes, along the dusty road that ran behind the farm, down to the lanes. There were two lanes - one was short; the other long and that was their names: The Long and Short lane. When they were younger the short lane was as far as they went. It ended abruptly, turning into a cow field. The long lane, however, was a different story altogether. The first straight of the long lane was longer than the short lane. After that it meandered through the countryside, with other lanes coming off it. It seemed to have no end. There were always new places to discover, new dens to build. Dylan and Danny were seasoned explorers and had abandoned the overgrown tracks. They now explored the area by water. \\r\\nThat day they were investigating a new stream they had discovered by chance the previous day. It was at the bottom of a corn field. The water was crystal clear and full of life. Danny had discovered the stream whilst stalking a coypu. The giant rat had bolted across the field and into the thick undergrowth that concealed the waterway. It was like discovering a seam of diamonds! It glistened and shimmered in the July sun, the ripples dancing in the light. \\r\\nThe boys sped along the lane, on their bikes, creating dust clouds which billowed out behind them. Arriving at the corn field, they hurriedly dropped their bikes, and set off on foot towards the hidden stream.\\r\\n“I hope we find some dragon fly larvae today,” said Dylan.\\r\\n“They can eat fish you know,” replied Danny.\\r\\n“Don’t I know it! They quite like human too. Last time I caught one it had a go at my finger!” said Dylan with disbelief.\\r\\n“What do you want to find more of them for then?” asked Danny.\\r\\n“I want to put them in the stream nearer the house, so that we will have more dragon flies buzzing around. You know, the really big ones,” replied Dylan frankly.\\r\\n“Good idea. We could take some crayfish back with us too,” suggested Danny.\\r\\n“If there are any,” muttered Dylan.\\r\\nIn front of the boys was a giant elder, its branches reaching for the azure sky. The tree was laden with fruits, its boughs straining under the weight. The clusters of berries formed small parasols that swayed in the warm breeze, providing the boys with much needed shade. At the base of the tree ran the stream. The boys approached it in silence as not to disturb any wildlife. As the stream came into view they heard the distinctive sound of frogs leaping into the water. It mystified them how these amphibians could sense their approach.\r\n  \r\nDylan and Danny had stopped wearing welly boots when exploring water courses. They were not comfortable when cycling and they never came up high enough. Far too many adventures had been cut short because of waterlogged feet. The boys now wore plastic sandals which were perfect. These incredible inventions were virtually indestructible. It did mean that you felt all the living creatures in the stream but this just added to the experience.\\r\\nThey set off up river, following the ditch around the edge of the field. As they waded they fished with Jam jars and nets made from old tights and badminton rackets, scraping the bed for hidden tit-bits. The harvest was bountiful. They caught stone loaches, minnows, sticklebacks, tadpoles, whirly gig beetles, great diving beetles and thousands of fresh water shrimps. However, they found no dragon fly larvae and no trace of crayfish.\\r\\nAs they traveled through the undergrowth, it became thicker and denser. No longer could they see either bank. Brambles and bushes, rushes and reeds hid the sides. The stream appeared to be narrowing. It was being slowly choked by the ever encroaching vegetation. The going got tougher and the boys were now struggling, carefully weaving their way through brambles as thick as your arm; nettles the size of cows and reeds that were like razors. They were thinking of turning back when they spied a sharp turn in the stream ahead.\\r\\n“That looks interesting,” commented Dylan, “we’ll have lunch when we get there.”\\r\\n“Good idea, I’m starving!” said Danny enthusiastically.\\r\\nThe boys were amazed at what they found. As they turned the corner, the vegetation opened up to show a waterfall complete with plunge pool. The water cascaded down rocks coated with mosses into a pool that must have been the size of a small car. Towards the shore were large boulders, surrounded by reeds. All around the pool were low shrubs covered with deep red berries and purple and yellow flowers. In the shallows they could see fish and eels darting and writhing between the rocks and reeds.\\r\\n“What a superb spot for lunch!” exclaimed Danny.\\r\\n“Let’s climb up on to the top and have our lunch up looking over the pool,” suggested Dylan.\r\n \r\nThe way to the top was difficult. The boys had to claw their way through the undergrowth. They were, however, driven by hunger and ploughed on through, tearing off branches and ripping their way between the small trees. Finally they reached the summit. The view from the lip of the waterfall was breathtaking. They could see the whole pool and could make out giant rocks on the bed. In the deep they could make out the shadows and silhouettes of giant eels, much bigger than either had ever seen. \\r\\nThat sat down on the edge dangling the feet watching the beasts lurking in the deep. They got out their lunch and started eating. It was like they hadn''t eaten in weeks, the hot sun and mornings adventures had definitely helped work up an appetite. \\r\\nAfter their lunch of cheese and tomato sandwiches and crisps, they sat chatting soaking in the atmosphere. \\r\\n“This place is the coolest!” said Danny.\\r\\n“I reckon you could swim in there. It’s big enough,” enthused Dylan.\\r\\n“Those eels look dangerous though,” said Danny with concern.\\r\\n“Yes I agree. You wouldn''t take your shoes off would you! Those trees, do you know what they are?” asked Dylan, gesturing towards the small trees that surrounded the pool.\\r\\n“Which ones?” asked Danny.\\r\\n“Those with the bright red berries and yellow and purple flowers,” said Dylan. As he spoke he saw Danny’s face change. He suddenly looked very worried.\\r\\n“I think we could be in trouble,” said Danny.\\r\\nAt that moment Dylan remembered his mum’s words to him earlier that day.\\r\\n“Deadly Nightshade…But we''ve touched it!” he yelled.\\r\\n“Not only have we touched it, but we''ve also just eaten. All the poison on our hands has been transferred to our food which is now inside us,” said Danny.\\r\\n“We’ll be dead in minutes!” panicked Dylan.\\r\\n“I don’t think it works that quickly. We''ve got at least a few hours, maybe a day,” said Danny trying to ease Dylan’s fears.\\r\\nThe boys’ world suddenly started falling down around them.\\r\\n“I’ll never start secondary school,” said Dylan.\\r\\n“I’ll never see Joe Parsons in year 8 again. She’s lush!” replied Danny.\\r\\n“What are you worrying about girls for? We’re going to DIE!” screamed Dylan.\\r\\n“Calm down. Right we need to think. What are we going to do?” asked Danny calmly.\\r\\n“We’re going to die! Do you not understand? It’s too late!” repeated Dylan.\\r\\n“Look we might be able to slow it down. We don’t know how much poison we''ve both had,” said Danny nervously.\\r\\n“I was sucking crisp crumbs off my fingers! I’m doomed!” squealed Dylan.\\r\\n“Right, first things first, let’s wash whatever’s left on us off. Last one in is a loser!” shouted Danny, grinning like a madman. \\r\\nThen Danny did something completely unexpected. He leaped from the top of the waterfall into the pool below. Danny jumped without fear, like a sky diver leaping from a plane. He hit the water with an almighty splash. Water lapped up the sides of the pool, temporarily submerging the edges. \\r\\nDylan wasn''t so confident.\\r\\n“Come on, the water’s lush. Look, we’ll be dead this time tomorrow, let’s make the most of it!” shouted Danny.\\r\\nHe’s right Dylan thought to himself. I''ve got nothing to lose!\\r\\nHe threw himself off the top. He shot through the air like a frog diving for a fly, entering the water with a tiny splash.\\r\\nDanny whooped with joy as Dylan surfaced.\\r\\n“Wow! That was fabuloso!” congratulated Danny.\\r\\n“It might have looked good, but I''ve really hurt my knee,” said Dylan holding back the tears. The boys clambered out of the pool and inspected the wound. Dylan had a long gash along his knee with a nasty graze around it.\\r\\n“I bashed it on the rock. I went too deep. I managed to lift the other leg in time. But this knee just wouldn''t move quickly enough!” winced Dylan.\\r\\n\r\n“It looks nasty, we better get back and get Mum to look at it,” said Danny.\\r\\n“Why? We’re going to be dead tomorrow. It doesn''t hurt that much anyway. Come on, lets jump some more,” replied Dylan frankly.\\r\\nThe boys continued jumping all afternoon. It was bliss. The water was cool and refreshing. They experimented with a variety of different jumps: dives, bombs, somersaults, skids and handstands. They had never been so bold and reckless. \\r\\nThe boys decided to make their way back to the farm. They were exhausted. Sadness flooded their hearts as they left the hidden pool. The waterfall had provided them with one of the best days of their lives. They knew that they would never forget it, but they wouldn’t have chance would they? How could this place be so terrible?\\r\\nThe boys climbed on their bikes and set off home at a more leisurely pace. The birds were back from their midday refuges, singing from every tree, flitting from shrub to shrub, chattering endlessly, whilst getting ready to roost. \\r\\nZooming along the lane the boys talked about their adventures.\\r\\n“I bet I can cycle no handed for longer than you,” challenged Danny.\\r\\n“Are you mad? I am a master of the ancient art of no handed cycling! You are merely my pupil!” boasted Dylan. \\r\\n“Yeah right. Let’s change the challenge then. We’ve got nothing to live for.” Danny paused, thinking of how to make this task more exciting.\\r\\n“We have to race no handed.”\\r\\nThey skidded to a halt. Dylan and Danny started counting down together, like they had done so many times before.\\r\\n“3, 2, 1- GO!”\\r\\nBoth boys started off gingerly, neck and neck. They looked very strange cycling as fast as they could with their arms by their side. Danny started edging forward. They passed by the cow shed, startling the young heifers sheltering indoors. This in turn flushed out four pheasants, which ran in front of the boys. Danny swerved and clipped the front of Dylan’s tire, sending the pair of them headlong into the gritty lane. \\r\\n“Ouch! My elbow!” moaned Danny. \\r\\n“My other knee matches,” observed Dylan, “It could be worse. It could have been fatal.”\\r\\nThe boys retrieved their bikes, straightened their handlebars and saddles, and sat down by the side of the track.\\r\\nWhilst sitting nursing their wounds, the boys noticed a constant trail of hornets flying back and forth past them. \\r\\n“I wonder where they are off to?” commented Danny.\\r\\n“Flying back and forth to their nest I suspect,” replied Dylan. \\r\\n“Shall we follow them? I’ve always wanted to see a Hornets nest,” suggested Danny.\\r\\nDylan considered Danny’s idea. He had always wanted to see a hornets nest. Wasp nests had always fascinated him with their elaborate paper construction which looked so sturdy until you touched it. A hornets’ nest would be so much more exciting, like an alien palace on some distant planet. They were, however, a place where large numbers of hornets could be found, and they were dangerous. \\r\\n“OK, let’s do it,” said Dylan reluctantly.\\r\\n“Right, which way do we go? They seem to be going in two directions,” replied Danny ponderously.\\r\\n“If you look carefully, the hornets flying this way aren’t carrying anything,” noted Dylan, “That must mean that they are flying away from the nest.”\\r\\n“So we need to go that when then!” exclaimed Danny triumphantly.\\r\\nCharging off in the direction of the nest, the boys abandoned their bikes and nets. What would they need them for now? Who knows where the hornets would lead them? They went over fences, through fields, under bushes until the hornets lead them to the pear tree which was opposite the farm house. As they neared the tree, they noticed a constant buzzing floating through the air. \\r\\n“There must be millions of them,” commented Dylan in hushed voice.\\r\\nDanny noticed that these giant wasps all seemed to be entering the tree through a tiny crevice which was roughly at the boys’ eye level.\\r\\n“What do we do now?” Dylan asked. Yes, they had found the nest, but what were they to do with it?\\r\\n“Okay, here’s the plan,” explained Danny. He paused to collect his thoughts and then resumed. “We’re going to find some long sticks. Then we’re going to jam them in the hole. That should get them going. Then we run, faster than we’ve ever run before.”\\r\\n“I thought you we were just going to find it? Why do we have to wind them up?” asked Dylan.\\r\\n“Look, we’re going to die. We might as well live dangerously in the short time that we have left,” replied Danny.\\r\\nSo they searched the nearby hedgerows until they found what they required: two sticks, which were long enough to give them a head start; cow parsley would be perfect. Creeping towards the tree, Danny readied his weapon. \\r\\n“When I say, you run as fast as your legs can carry you. We’ll go back to the bikes and then home.”\\r\\nCarefully Danny, edged his stick to towards the whole. The hornets were already aware that something was not quite right. They had started to buzz around the end of the stick. A hornet landed on the end and started trying to sink its giant sting into it. This attracting another hornet who started doing the same, only this time closer to Danny’s hands. \\r\\n“Careful – they’re not stupid. Eventually they’re going to realize that your hand is what is controlling it!” warned Dylan. \\r\\nThen it happened. \\r\\nHornets started streaming out of the hole, hundreds and thousands of them. To the boys, time seemed to slow down. They looked in horror as the hornets, sped towards them!\\r\\n“RUN!” screamed Danny.\\r\\nDropping the sticks, the boys turned and fled. They dashed across the fields, under the bushes and over the fences. When they got to their bikes, they didn’t stop; they picked them up and started running with them before hopping on. Speeding along the desiccated lane, the boys laughed triumphantly! They had done it – escaped the wrath of the hornets! They’d pretty much cheated death! Simultaneously, the boys realized that they hadn’t escaped the grim reaper. The poison they had ingested earlier was racing through their system, slowly poisoning every cell – death was inevitable.\\r\\n“I had a really good day today Dee,” said Danny sadly, “I can’t believe it’s all going to be over tomorrow.”\\r\\n“I know – but it has been good! We’ve definitely lived life to the full. We’ve taken risks, felt the blood pumping through our veins and pushed ourselves to the limit. It’s been an amazing last day. I think I will die a happy man…” Dylan’s words trailed off solemnly to silence. \\r\\nThe boys turned the corner of the lane for the last time, their hearts heavy. Suddenly a head appeared from a window in the mill.\\r\\n“What have you idiots been doing? Are you completely brainless?” yelled Bob, Dylan’s dad.\\r\\nThe boys skidded to a halt, looking sheepish.\\r\\n“Well, I know what you’ve been doing. I watched you from the top of the roof. What were you thinking?” asked Bob, his voice lowering.\\r\\n“We’re sorry. We were being stupid,” replied Dylan his voice wavering with regret, as he held back the tears.\\r\\n“To cycle no handed along the lane is one thing, but to wind up a whole hornets nest. Well, I’m lost for words. You need to put your bikes away, tidily, and get yourselves cleaned up. It’s straight to bed after dinner for you! Go on clear off!” scorned Bob. \\r\\nCycling off, their tails between their legs, the boys looked at the ground shamefully. What had they done? Being so wrapped up in their adventures they had completely forgotten about their families. They had squandered their last day pulling stupid and dangerous stunts when they could have been spending time with their nearest and dearest. Danny and Dylan put their bikes and equipment away quickly and went indoors.\\r\\n“What have you pair been doing? I don’t really need to ask – your father has told me everything! Look at your knees, was it worth it? You could have really hurt yourself. Worse than that you could be dead! Three stings from a hornet can kill a full grown man. What were you thinking?” asked Molly, Dylan’s mum, her forehead deeply furrowed.\\r\\n”We’re really sorry,” yelped Dylan, before bursting into tears.\\r\\nHis wailing set Danny off, the full implications of what they had dawning on them. \\r\\n“I’ve no sympathy for you! How do you think I would feel if you’d have died today? You can cry all you like. Now go and getting washed and ready for bed, as that’s where you’re going after dinner,” explained Molly, coldly.\\r\\nThis only set the boys off more. If only she knew. Tomorrow she would be crying.\\r\\nThe rest of the evening was uneventful. Danny and Dylan were on the verge of tears throughout dinner, which was a silent, sombre affair. They cleared their plates away without words and went and sat by their parents.\\r\\n“Off to bed then,” said Bill, Danny’s dad, who had been informed of the day’s events. \\r\\n“No reading; lights straight off,” commented Bob.\\r\\nThen the boys did something they didn’t usual do. They hugged their parents’ goodnight.\\r\\n“What’s all this? Feeling sorry for yourselves are you?” asked Molly.\\r\\n“Tomorrow you’re staying on the farm. I’ve got a list of things that need doing,” said Bill seriously. “You can start by moving the gravel from the behind the garage. It’s spreading, all over the place.”\\r\\n“OK dad. Night then,” replied Danny holding back the tears.\\r\\nThe boys got ready for bed in silence, each one lost in their own thoughts. The lights went off and they were enveloped in the inky blackness of their shuttered room. \\r\\n“Good night Danny. You’re the best cousin ever,” said a voice from the darkness.\\r\\n“You too Dee. Sorry about today. I wish they weren’t so cross with us. If only they knew,” said Danny resolutely. \\r\\n“Don’t think about it,” replied Dylan flatly.\\r\\n“Do you think it will hurt?” asked Danny.\\r\\n“Don’t think about it,” repeated Dylan his voice trailing off.\\r\\n“Dylan are you asleep?”\\r\\n“Dylan, can you hear me... Dylan?”\\r\\nDanny woke up to find a brilliant golden light hitting him straight in the face. He rubbed his eyes. Was it true? Was he still alive? He glanced around the room making sure he was in the same place he fell asleep. He was, he’d survived! He leaped out of bed and ran over to Dylan.\\r\\n“Wake up! We’re still alive!” whooped Danny.\\r\\nDylan did not move; he just lay there with the sun shining upon him.  Danny started to panic. Had the poison killed Dylan but spared his own life?\\r\\nSlowly opening his eyes, Dylan grinned at Danny.\\r\\n“Fooled you!”\\r\\nThat day the boys worked hard and spent all their time around their parents. They didn’t complain once; they were happy to spend time with their family.', 'Deadly Nightshade by Owen Knowles', 0, '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '58-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-09-29 13:17:21', '2016-09-29 21:17:21', '', 58, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/58-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

He imagined her to have milky-white skin that he knew must feel like porcelain silk. She probably bathed in the same oils that his clients'' wives bought on their journeys to the Far East: She was an exotic beauty.\\r\\nMuch later, the train pulled into Kalamazoo. The whistle, along with the night-smoky air, let him know that he was in the town. A Negro with the ability to pass with a black tweed suit with a black cap with buttons held a cardboard sign that read, ''Bill Snodgrass Here.'' He walked over to the Negro and handed him his carpenter''s bag that contained long johns, socks, a comb, five-cent candies, and  an advertisement to see Hilda the Fat Lady at the Barnum''s Circus. The Negro, a man named Solomon, opened the back door of the horse-drawn paddy wagon for him. He had finally arrived. The trot through Kalamazoo was quaint and pleasant. The town reminded him of Detroit except for a hill they passed going across the railroad tracks. He saw big Craftsman-style homes on his right and on his left, Irish orphans headed onward with their bare feet stuck out the windows. Solomon looked back at him.\\r\\n\"They''s headed toward the farms. Down by Dowagiac, sir,\" Solomon pointed and waved. \\r\\nBill said nothing. The wagon had not moved because they were stuck at a railroad pass, waiting for his train to cross the tracks and head toward Solomon''s adopted hometown, a fairly magical place named Niles, Michigan, where a conjurer knew more darkness than Stephen Foster.\\r\\nSeveral soap-deficient farm children came up to them to pound on the wagon''s wooden side. \"Please, sir,\" they said, \"spare us some change.\" He reached into his pocket and pulled out his last change: three pennies. He threw them down on the yellow-green grass and quietly laughed into the night air as they crossed the train tracks. One child threw a piece of unclean celery at the wagon, and was quickly slapped by his mother. The horse''s pace quickened into a competitive trot. Bill wanted to fall asleep but all around him was dirt-clumped hay, and Solomon hummed an odd tune that was strangely comforting. He tried to stay awake but he fell asleep anyway — he was exhausted after days of travel.\\r\\nHe woke soon and Bill pulled the sketch out of his left pants pocket again and read the note attached that he had ignored before. He skimmed down to his favorite line and reread it: Sorry for the sketch. Mother says that it''s improper for a lady-in-waiting to take a photograph without her husband-to-be. Will have to accept my apologies. Bill looked over the sketch.  The artist, Ethel''s brother, had captured the angular symmetry of her heart-shaped face. The eyes were only a day-old, and the mouth was also small and unassuming like his. The hair, according to the letter attached, was brown with a slight hint of blonde.\\r\\nThe Negro pulled the horse-drawn paddy wagon behind the house, next to the shed  where the livery was. He opened the door and assisted Bill. \"Right this way,\" he said. He opened the back door where Bill was met by a butler with silver-gray hair and spectacles on a face that reminded him of his favorite author, Mark Twain, whose sketch he had mastered as an apprentice when on his first great lesson on life a few years ago on December 23, 1868, he stood in Young Men''s Hall to view the then-obscure author speak on the heart of man. The lesson he learned was nothing of importance. He learned more from his favorite author by reading than anything else. \\r\\n\"You are Mr. Snodgrass?\" Bill nodded his head. \"Right this way,\" the butler said, and he followed him. He was promptly seated in the front sitting room where a maid was pouring hot tea into a cup and fresh butter cookies were piled on top of a gold platter. Bill had not sat down for two minutes when Ethel entered the room without being introduced. She looked the same as her sketch, only younger and with a black gown on. She took one look at him and to no one in particular said, \"He''s not as handsome as his sketch. He may as well shoot Dan Rice! Oh, Mother, I don''t know if he''ll do,\" and exited the room as quickly as she came. The maid, who had been pretending to fluff Egyptian-lace pillows, handed Bill a platter of cookies. \\r\\nAs the maid left the room, he thought to himself, ''Be patient, Ethel. Marriage is a matter of responsibility and obligation, not convenience.'' Ethel was correct, though; he should have shown her a sketch of himself that did not embellish his best features.

He walked over to the Negro and handed him his carpenter''s bag that contained long johns, socks, a comb, five-cent candies, and  an advertisement to see Hilda the Fat Lady at the Barnum''s Circus. The Negro, a man named Solomon, opened the back door of the horse-drawn paddy wagon for him. He had finally arrived. The trot through Kalamazoo was quaint and pleasant. The town reminded him of Detroit except for a hill they passed going across the railroad tracks. He saw big Craftsman-style homes on his right and on his left, Irish orphans headed onward with their bare feet stuck out the windows. Solomon looked back at him.\\r\\n\"They''s headed toward the farms. Down by Dowagiac, sir,\" Solomon pointed and waved. \\r\\nBill said nothing. The wagon had not moved because they were stuck at a railroad pass, waiting for his train to cross the tracks and head toward Solomon''s adopted hometown, a fairly magical place named Niles, Michigan, where a conjurer knew more darkness than Stephen Foster.\\r\\nSeveral soap-deficient farm children came up to them to pound on the wagon''s wooden side. \"Please, sir,\" they said, \"spare us some change.\" He reached into his pocket and pulled out his last change: three pennies. He threw them down on the yellow-green grass and quietly laughed into the night air as they crossed the train tracks. One child threw a piece of unclean celery at the wagon, and was quickly slapped by his mother. The horse''s pace quickened into a competitive trot. Bill wanted to fall asleep but all around him was dirt-clumped hay, and Solomon hummed an odd tune that was strangely comforting. He tried to stay awake but he fell asleep anyway — he was exhausted after days of travel.\\r\\nHe woke soon and Bill pulled the sketch out of his left pants pocket again and read the note attached that he had ignored before. He skimmed down to his favorite line and reread it: Sorry for the sketch. Mother says that it''s improper for a lady-in-waiting to take a photograph without her husband-to-be. Will have to accept my apologies. Bill looked over the sketch.  The artist, Ethel''s brother, had captured the angular symmetry of her heart-shaped face. The eyes were only a day-old, and the mouth was also small and unassuming like his. The hair, according to the letter attached, was brown with a slight hint of blonde.\\r\\nThe Negro pulled the horse-drawn paddy wagon behind the house, next to the shed  where the livery was. He opened the door and assisted Bill. \"Right this way,\" he said. He opened the back door where Bill was met by a butler with silver-gray hair and spectacles on a face that reminded him of his favorite author, Mark Twain, whose sketch he had mastered as an apprentice when on his first great lesson on life a few years ago on December 23, 1868, he stood in Young Men''s Hall to view the then-obscure author speak on the heart of man. The lesson he learned was nothing of importance. He learned more from his favorite author by reading than anything else. \\r\\n\"You are Mr. Snodgrass?\" Bill nodded his head. \"Right this way,\" the butler said, and he followed him. He was promptly seated in the front sitting room where a maid was pouring hot tea into a cup and fresh butter cookies were piled on top of a gold platter. Bill had not sat down for two minutes when Ethel entered the room without being introduced. She looked the same as her sketch, only younger and with a black gown on. She took one look at him and to no one in particular said, \"He''s not as handsome as his sketch. He may as well shoot Dan Rice! Oh, Mother, I don''t know if he''ll do,\" and exited the room as quickly as she came. The maid, who had been pretending to fluff Egyptian-lace pillows, handed Bill a platter of cookies. \\r\\nAs the maid left the room, he thought to himself, ''Be patient, Ethel. Marriage is a matter of responsibility and obligation, not convenience.'' Ethel was correct, though; he should have shown her a sketch of himself that did not embellish his best features. Nonetheless, Bill Snodgrass pulled out his pocket watch and began to count the seconds.\r\n', 'An Obligation in Kalamazoo by Piper Davenport', 0, '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '54-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-09-29 13:24:51', '2016-09-29 21:24:51', '', 54, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/54-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(606, 1, '2016-09-29 13:42:32', '2016-09-29 21:42:32', 'Weeks afterwards, she thought about something he had told her one day. He’d said that his mother was convinced that he could charm the birds out of the trees. She knew this was just a silly expression. And yet . . .Perhaps his mother had recognized something in him that no one else had.\n\nHer three-year old daughter had been tired all day and now lay sleeping on the sofa with her new Barbie backpack clutched tightly in her hand. On the day she received it, he had taken a photograph of her wearing it, almost as large as she was. Her first backpack.They had laughed at the image of her attending her first day of school not too many years from now with the pack strapped to her back.\nAs she watched the small form in its slumber, she drew up her legs tighter, took another sip of wine and for the first time in almost a month, closed her eyes and allowed her mind to drift as the warm blanket of alcohol began to comfort her.\n\nThe birds. It was such a small and seemingly silly thing he had begun. Perhaps because there was no longer anything left in his life, or perhaps he saw them as the only living thing he could relate to. Whatever his reasons, he fed the birds every morning and they became known as Daddy’s Birds. There was no proper bird feeder on the deck, just an upturned piece of plastic upon which he poured the birdseed mixture, albeit sufficient to feed every bird for miles around. And they would come. Every day. In many different varieties. There were Blue Tits, Mouse birds, Bee Eaters, Northern cardinals, house sparrows and many others she did not even recognize. But among these twittering, flittering bursts of color and song, his favorite had been a simple common dove that, for reasons of its own, had taken to sitting on a branch of a nearby peach tree to wait for him. He would amble onto the deck when he awoke from yet another night of pain and terror on the couch and fill the plastic tray with seeds. The small dove that he maintained was a female would perk up, its head bobbing and its tail wagging when it heard the seeds being dispensed. As soon as he closed the patio door, the dove would glide down, peck at the morning’s offering, looking up every now and then and bob its head as if in gratitude.\n\nOnce the birds were eating, he could often open the patio door without too many of the birds fleeing. The dove, although a bit skittish, would not fly away unless it was approached. He would stand and make small cooing sounds, which the bird appeared to enjoy as it pecked at the seed, apparently aware that it was in no immediate danger. And the whistling. He would stand at the patio door for a while, before his legs went numb and he had to hobble back to the sofa, and whistle between his teeth, trying to mimic the sounds the birds made.They responded to this strange man-made sound and would often chirp back at him. The dove’s head would bob back and forth more vigorously and its tail would flash up and down like a metronome. She wondered what he was saying to them and if they somehow understood. He’d been doing this for months and she had taken to buying special packs of wild birdseed so he always had a fresh supply. The dove particularly like sunflower seeds while the others would eventually pick up every scrap of millet. If he were late on some mornings, depending on his pain level or degree of panic, he was greeted by a chorus of wild birds, lined up along the top of the deck as if waiting for their breakfast. They’d flutter away when he went out with the cup of seed but would return as soon as he went indoors again and he’d watch them from the door, careful not to move the curtain and startle them away.\n\nThe last morning was like any other and she had been preceded down the stairs as usual by their daughter, Kinsley, shouting, “Good morning, daddy!'' - the latest addition to her rapidly expanding vocabulary. The night before had been particularly hard. He’d had a massive pain attack and had lain on the floor, his face white with terror and his eyes a rheumy yellow green color as the pain gripped tighter in his spine and chest, threatening to squeeze the life out of him like a sponge. She wasn’t sure what he thought at times like this, but when she looked into his eyes she often felt, and hoped, that he drifted away to some imaginary place where the pain could not reach him. But she knew it was not really that way and that she was only consoling herself. He had not slept in their bed for almost two years. It was too painful. Instead, he stretched out on a long leather sofa in the lounge downstairs, tossing and turning until he found a position that would allow him to drift into an unfulfilling doze. He never really slept properly. It was more of a respite from exhaustion and the powerful narcotics he took.\n\nShe had watched him fading away for almost three years. Watched as the pain attacks became more frequent, more vicious and more personal. Pain had relentlessly drained the life from him, dulled his eyes and stolen his personality and character; leaving behind a scared, withered shell of a man. The pain medication did work, but not enough to offer any real relief, ‘painkiller’ being a misnomer. He lived with the shackles of pain constantly.  He’d recently been prescribed a very powerful narcotic but was too scared to take it. Several deaths had been ascribed to some of its irreversible side effects, notably that of respiratory failure. It was a drug intended for terminal cancer patients to control their breakthrough pain. Patients who received round-the-clock morphine. Patients who no longer cared about the adverse effects of pain medication and who would welcome the oblivion such a drug might inadvertently bring them.\n\nThe look on Kinsley’s face that morning was etched into her mind. She was standing beside her father with her hand on his arm and for the very first time, he had not acknowledged her enthusiastic morning greeting. The air in the room was heavy and stale and she had known without looking that there would be no greeting. His hands had been a pale blue color and as she had slowly walked over to him, her heart filled with dread. She had felt a certain relief when she saw that his eyes were closed and that if there were any justice in this world, that he had simply gone to sleep. Through searing tears she had said, “Let Daddy sleep a bit more, sweetie. He’s tired. Really tired.” And then she had made the phone call she had known was inevitable and things had moved quickly. Kinsley was taken next door to play with her little friend while arrangements were made at home. Before she left, Kinsley was told to kiss daddy night-night and had remarked, “Brr, daddy’s cold.” And then with great care so as not to awaken him, she had had pulled the blanket up a little more to keep her father warm.\n\nThe church service had been short and personal with just one close friend and her sons in attendance. Kinsley had spent the morning asking where daddy was, which had made it almost unbearable. He had insisted on being cremated, because pain would not likely be interested in mere ashes. \n\nThe days drifted by and blurred into each other. The well-wishers had tapered off and the house felt bigger than ever, with Kinsley often asking where her daddy was and saying that she missed him, even though she meant that she loved him. But perhaps she really did miss him, too. This had produced the strongest tears and all she could do was say that daddy had gone away to sleep and that they would just have to wait until they could see him again.\n\nIt had been a brighter-than-usual morning and it was Kinsley who had first remarked on the noise. Even from within the house, the sound of birds was quite loud, almost demanding attention.\nKinsley had pulled aside the curtain and shouted, “Look, Mommy. Birds!”\n\nAnd she had known immediately what her daughter was looking at. She had opened the cupboard, taken down the half-filled bag of birdseed and scooped up a full cup of the contents. Taking Kinsley’s hand, she had pulled aside the curtain on the patio and the sight that met her had made her gasp. Hundreds of birds of all sizes and shapes were lined on the top of the deck. There were birds in the jasmine vines, birds in the peach tree and even some on the ground. But among this assemblage, sitting in its usual spot was the small dove watching her intently, its head and tail bobbing. Some of the birds had flittered away when she had walked out onto the deck, but most of them had simply watched her in silence through black, beady eyes as she emptied the cup into the plastic feeder. She had felt as if she somehow offered them an explanation, but was not able to do the bird whistle he had done so well. Besides, what would she whistle to them? She had barely made it back indoors before the birds had descended and they had watched them, Kinsley rapt with fascination as the birds ate the seeds.

(607, 1, '2016-09-29 13:42:57', '2016-09-29 21:42:57', 'Weeks afterwards, she thought about something he had told her one day. He’d said that his mother was convinced that he could charm the birds out of the trees. She knew this was just a silly expression. And yet . . .Perhaps his mother had recognized something in him that no one else had.\\r\\nHer three-year old daughter had been tired all day and now lay sleeping on the sofa with her new Barbie backpack clutched tightly in her hand. On the day she received it, he had taken a photograph of her wearing it, almost as large as she was. Her first backpack.They had laughed at the image of her attending her first day of school not too many years from now with the pack strapped to her back.\r\nAs she watched the small form in its slumber, she drew up her legs tighter, took another sip of wine and for the first time in almost a month, closed her eyes and allowed her mind to drift as the warm blanket of alcohol began to comfort her.\\r\\nThe birds. It was such a small and seemingly silly thing he had begun. Perhaps because there was no longer anything left in his life, or perhaps he saw them as the only living thing he could relate to. Whatever his reasons, he fed the birds every morning and they became known as Daddy’s Birds. There was no proper bird feeder on the deck, just an upturned piece of plastic upon which he poured the birdseed mixture, albeit sufficient to feed every bird for miles around. And they would come. Every day. In many different varieties. There were Blue Tits, Mouse birds, Bee Eaters, Northern cardinals, house sparrows and many others she did not even recognize. But among these twittering, flittering bursts of color and song, his favorite had been a simple common dove that, for reasons of its own, had taken to sitting on a branch of a nearby peach tree to wait for him. He would amble onto the deck when he awoke from yet another night of pain and terror on the couch and fill the plastic tray with seeds. The small dove that he maintained was a female would perk up, its head bobbing and its tail wagging when it heard the seeds being dispensed. As soon as he closed the patio door, the dove would glide down, peck at the morning’s offering, looking up every now and then and bob its head as if in gratitude.\\r\\nOnce the birds were eating, he could often open the patio door without too many of the birds fleeing. The dove, although a bit skittish, would not fly away unless it was approached. He would stand and make small cooing sounds, which the bird appeared to enjoy as it pecked at the seed, apparently aware that it was in no immediate danger. And the whistling. He would stand at the patio door for a while, before his legs went numb and he had to hobble back to the sofa, and whistle between his teeth, trying to mimic the sounds the birds made.They responded to this strange man-made sound and would often chirp back at him. The dove’s head would bob back and forth more vigorously and its tail would flash up and down like a metronome. She wondered what he was saying to them and if they somehow understood. He’d been doing this for months and she had taken to buying special packs of wild birdseed so he always had a fresh supply. The dove particularly like sunflower seeds while the others would eventually pick up every scrap of millet. If he were late on some mornings, depending on his pain level or degree of panic, he was greeted by a chorus of wild birds, lined up along the top of the deck as if waiting for their breakfast. They’d flutter away when he went out with the cup of seed but would return as soon as he went indoors again and he’d watch them from the door, careful not to move the curtain and startle them away.\\r\\nThe last morning was like any other and she had been preceded down the stairs as usual by their daughter, Kinsley, shouting, “Good morning, daddy!'' - the latest addition to her rapidly expanding vocabulary. The night before had been particularly hard. He’d had a massive pain attack and had lain on the floor, his face white with terror and his eyes a rheumy yellow green color as the pain gripped tighter in his spine and chest, threatening to squeeze the life out of him like a sponge. She wasn’t sure what he thought at times like this, but when she looked into his eyes she often felt, and hoped, that he drifted away to some imaginary place where the pain could not reach him. But she knew it was not really that way and that she was only consoling herself. He had not slept in their bed for almost two years. It was too painful. Instead, he stretched out on a long leather sofa in the lounge downstairs, tossing and turning until he found a position that would allow him to drift into an unfulfilling doze. He never really slept properly. It was more of a respite from exhaustion and the powerful narcotics he took.\\r\\nShe had watched him fading away for almost three years. Watched as the pain attacks became more frequent, more vicious and more personal. Pain had relentlessly drained the life from him, dulled his eyes and stolen his personality and character; leaving behind a scared, withered shell of a man. The pain medication did work, but not enough to offer any real relief, ‘painkiller’ being a misnomer. He lived with the shackles of pain constantly.  He’d recently been prescribed a very powerful narcotic but was too scared to take it. Several deaths had been ascribed to some of its irreversible side effects, notably that of respiratory failure. It was a drug intended for terminal cancer patients to control their breakthrough pain. Patients who received round-the-clock morphine. Patients who no longer cared about the adverse effects of pain medication and who would welcome the oblivion such a drug might inadvertently bring them.\\r\\nThe look on Kinsley’s face that morning was etched into her mind. She was standing beside her father with her hand on his arm and for the very first time, he had not acknowledged her enthusiastic morning greeting. The air in the room was heavy and stale and she had known without looking that there would be no greeting. His hands had been a pale blue color and as she had slowly walked over to him, her heart filled with dread. She had felt a certain relief when she saw that his eyes were closed and that if there were any justice in this world, that he had simply gone to sleep. Through searing tears she had said, “Let Daddy sleep a bit more, sweetie. He’s tired. Really tired.” And then she had made the phone call she had known was inevitable and things had moved quickly. Kinsley was taken next door to play with her little friend while arrangements were made at home. Before she left, Kinsley was told to kiss daddy night-night and had remarked, “Brr, daddy’s cold.” And then with great care so as not to awaken him, she had had pulled the blanket up a little more to keep her father warm.\\r\\nThe church service had been short and personal with just one close friend and her sons in attendance. Kinsley had spent the morning asking where daddy was, which had made it almost unbearable. He had insisted on being cremated, because pain would not likely be interested in mere ashes. \\r\\nThe days drifted by and blurred into each other. The well-wishers had tapered off and the house felt bigger than ever, with Kinsley often asking where her daddy was and saying that she missed him, even though she meant that she loved him. But perhaps she really did miss him, too. This had produced the strongest tears and all she could do was say that daddy had gone away to sleep and that they would just have to wait until they could see him again.\\r\\nIt had been a brighter-than-usual morning and it was Kinsley who had first remarked on the noise. Even from within the house, the sound of birds was quite loud, almost demanding attention.\r\nKinsley had pulled aside the curtain and shouted, “Look, Mommy. Birds!”\\r\\nAnd she had known immediately what her daughter was looking at. She had opened the cupboard, taken down the half-filled bag of birdseed and scooped up a full cup of the contents. Taking Kinsley’s hand, she had pulled aside the curtain on the patio and the sight that met her had made her gasp. Hundreds of birds of all sizes and shapes were lined on the top of the deck. There were birds in the jasmine vines, birds in the peach tree and even some on the ground. But among this assemblage, sitting in its usual spot was the small dove watching her intently, its head and tail bobbing. Some of the birds had flittered away when she had walked out onto the deck, but most of them had simply watched her in silence through black, beady eyes as she emptied the cup into the plastic feeder. She had felt as if she somehow offered them an explanation, but was not able to do the bird whistle he had done so well. Besides, what would she whistle to them? She had barely made it back indoors before the birds had descended and they had watched them, Kinsley rapt with fascination as the birds ate the seeds. And then, with a final glance towards the door, they took to the sky in all directions.\\r\\nThe birds never did return, no matter how much seed she put out. A few squirrels dropped by and stole the peanuts that were often included in the feed, but the birds never came back.\\r\\nExcept one.

(610, 1, '2016-09-29 15:19:02', '2016-09-29 23:19:02', 'Sometimes the name they give you is all wrong.  My paternal grandmother’s name was Nava, which, in Hebrew, translates to “beautiful.”  In the biblical Song of Songs, it says, “Thou art beautiful [nava], O my love, as Tirzah, beautiful [nava] as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.”  By the time I met my Nava, she wasn’t quite beautiful, or terrible.  She was essentially a shriveled up little raisin in a modest, tweed skirt and thirty-five-year-old glasses.  She was certainly sweet and cute, and raisiny, but I’m not sure she was beautiful.  I suppose at one time she was—her husband certainly thought so anyway.  \nOne day my father and I were talking about names, for some reason, children’s names; what you name your children.  I asked him if, when my mother was pregnant with me, he’d ever brought up the idea with her about naming me after his own father.  He exploded at me.\n\n“Gabriel!  What are you, fuckin’ stupid?!” he asked, rhetorically, I hope. \n \n“Well, Dad, I mean, you…” I began.\n\n“Look Gabriel; having a child is a huge responsibility, okay?  You can really fuck a kid up right from the beginning if you call him the wrong thing,” my father explained to me.  I protested.\n\n“The ‘wrong thing?’  Dad, you know, he was your father.”\n\n“So?” he frothed.  “He’s still my father, and you are my son, and it’s a terrible name so why would I do it to you?  MoRAD?” he roared, punching out the last syllable each time like a veteran heavyweight.  “You think I wanted to name you MoRAD?!  Next you’ll say I should have named you after me.  Efraim,” he said contemptuously of his own identity.  “Another fuckin’ retard name!”\n\nMy father, finished for the time being, got up from the dining room table, randomly announced that he was going to “The Camera Shop” and left. \n\nI didn’t know what the hell was the matter with him.  His bombastic, Israeli rants are a product of the desert from which he came, and are just meant to be endured and accepted.  He blows up all the time, like a rear-ended Pinto, but locating the catalyst usually proves a superhuman investigative feat.  I didn’t figure this one out for a while.  \n\nA few days ago I was sitting on my wife’s futon leafing through her Hebrew/English Dictionary.  This is the type of book I’m pleased that she has because it is also the type of book I would never spend fifteen cents on myself but that I secretly find interesting.  I, like any mature, serious-minded beneficiary of higher education, immediately looked for the translations of the words “penis” and “vagina” only to be thoroughly disappointed that this particular dictionary did not even list words at all, though the editors did, apparently, believe earnestly that the translation for “abundant breasts” (khazeh) shofe’a was a pertinent and necessary inclusion.  I looked for the translations of our names.  There was nothing for Gabriel and there was nothing for Efraim.  Then I remembered.  Him.  MoRAD.  I turned to the “M’s” and there it was:\n\n<em>(ba) MORAD (adj.): “on the way down.”</em>\n\nI closed my eyes and put my hand to my head.  He was right.  My grandfather never had a chance.  He was fucked over, as my father had put it, right from the beginning.\n\nDespite Nava’s beautiful name and in-step with Morad’s pessimistic one, they both suffered gravely from a type of psychosis known as vascular dementia before they mercifully died.  They lived in Australia and I lived in Pennsylvania, so I never saw their pitiful and piteous decline and descent into the dark.  In fact, I never met my grandfather.  My grandmother I was fortunate enough to meet when she was still basically together.  Like I said, she was very small.  \n\nThe two of them fell ill and expired prior the beginning of my career as an Emergency Medical Technician.  Because of this, I suppose, my perspective on their illness was not one formed by repeated exposure to these kinds of psychological destructions, but was a raw, emotional and desperate view, the view of an uneducated boy losing his grandparents.  After their diagnoses, I watched my father peerlessly for signs of forgetfulness, inattention, listlessness, wandering and confusion.  Although I know now that vascular dementia is not hereditary, I watch for changes in my own mentality, too.  I worry when I feel my brain losing focus, glazing over or getting fuzzy about one thing or another.  Maybe I’ve just been an intellectually unstimulated EMT for too long.\n\nSince I’ve started this job and have seen all kinds of age-induced dementia, the thought of watching my own father lose his mind still petrifies me.  The thought of going crazy myself, however, I no longer find troublesome.  I read an article in a magazine just the other day about a physician who specialized in gerontology.  In his vast career, he had examined and diagnosed thousands of patients with Alzheimer’s.  Recently, he wrote, he had been having memory and attention lapses himself and, after these problems worsened, he self-diagnosed Alzheimer’s.  While he saw another physician to have his suspicions confirmed – which they were – he already knew.  Worse infinitely than knowing the diagnosis; he knew the future, his future, and it’s not pretty.  Anything that involves peeing yourself and failing to recognize your children never is.  \n\nThis physician, still in the beginning of his descent, wrote lucidly and placidly about the disease and its effects on the brain and on the body.  He talked wistfully about the damage it had started to do to him, and he was candid with the reader and with himself about what it still had left to do.  I envied him as much as you can envy anyone with Alzheimer’s because I wanted to be as at ease with Fate as he. But I wrestle with illness and death in the daylight and the dark and becoming an EMT in no way helped exorcise those demons.  In many ways, they made them all too real.  In the realm of Alzheimer’s and dementia, though, perhaps my experiences with the geriatric psychiatric patients served to allay some of my fears about insanity.  Many people would argue that dementia isn’t funny, and, of course, when it’s you dealing with the demented parent or spouse, it’s not.  However, from the detached view of the EMT on a psych transport, when your elderly, female patient is demanding that you stop the ambulance “in the name of the United States Government and the Continental Congress,” it’s difficult to keep a straight face in the moment, even though you’re confronting real human tragedy.  I hope that finding that funny doesn’t make me a monster; I hope it makes me human.\n\nAs I write this, the date of my marriage to Ali is a mere fifty-odd days away.  Approaching this date of sublime happiness, there is also an element of sadness.  We are melding two families, and both have a history of mental illness.  One or both of us could wind up losing it, and that is frightening to me.  The children that I hope to make with her could wind up losing it, too.  I have seen what happens to people when they lose it.  It gets, well, lost.  I think about our vows.  We vow to love each other and help each other through sickness and in health, through it all.  We promise to love and honor and respect each other no matter what.  But what happens when you pledge your love to someone eternally and then, one day; he or she is not that person anymore?\n\nBen was lying facedown on a small sofa at Macomb Hospital’s Behavioral Health Unit.  He was wearing a gray tracksuit, though it was highly unlikely that he was going to be participating in a marathon anytime soon.  His gray hair was strewn this way and that and it stuck to the pillowcase once he sat down on the stretcher.  He had bits of egg and what looked like syrup – at least, I hoped it was syrup – on his jacket front and crystallized eye-boogers encrusted his eyelids.  It was two fifteen and he’d probably been sleeping all day.  And why not?  Nothing else to do.  There was Scrabble in the Unit’s game-room, but I didn’t observe any potential companions that looked up to a Triple Word Score anymore than Ben did.\n\nWe were taking Ben to a very upscale facility that specialized in “eldercare” and so this piqued my interest a little bit.  I am a very nosey person and, when I know we’re taking someone to a retirement home that has a yearlong waiting list to get in, I want to know a little bit more about the individual we’re taking there.  Maybe he married money, maybe he’s a war profiteer, maybe he’s a former member of the Johnson administration; I just want to know, that’s all.  Because Ben didn’t speak to me, I could snoop through his file.  I had no compunction about doing this.  Occasionally there was something in there I actually needed to know.    \n\nThere was the usual bullshit: medications, allergies, lab results, safety checks, vital signs, nursing notes.  I usually skip all this if I’m reasonably sure the patient isn’t going to croak during the ride.  I flip and flip through the pages until I get to what I’m really after: the physician’s narrative report.  Ben’s physician’s report shocked me so much that I pulled out my journal and copied it verbatim.  Sue me.\n\n“Ben ****** is a seventy-six year old Caucasian male with advanced Alzeheimer’s-related dementia.  He is essentially non-verbal and is currently incontinent of bowel and bladder.  Born and raised in England, apparently he was very smart as a child and got a full scholarship to the Sorbonne University in Paris.  After he graduated, he became and engineer and eventually came to the United States in the 1950s and became a Chief Executive for a company.  The patient retired when he was 60, at the beginning of his dementia.  The patient used to enjoy playing tennis and reading books.  Apparently at one time he could read forty books in one week which is, of course, quite an achievement.”    \n\nNow going two hours without soiling himself would be “quite an achievement” for Ben.  I became deeply depressed after reading, and copying, the physician’s narrative.  The report went on to say that Ben’s wife was “quite active and independent”.  I wondered briefly how exactly that was relevant and it annoyed me that the physician had put that in there, almost as if to mock Ben and his deplorable mental condition.  I surmised that the doctor who wrote the report was probably schtupping Ben’s wife.  I resented being exposed to this information and paranoid fantasy.  I felt ugly, like an intruder, like this was something nobody was supposed to know.  Now, of course, that I knew what he had been and now that I knew what he had become, I wanted to know more and more and more.  I wanted to know about the first moment double-breasted, pinstriped Ben fucked up in the office or at a high-power meeting.  I want to know the first time he looked at Bob but said, “Jim”.  I wanted to know the first time the phone rang and he answered the stapler.  How did this Goliath get taken down?  By a little neurological atrophy?  It didn’t seem possible.  If it got Ben, if it got Reagan, if it got my Morad and Nava…  \n	\nIt got Sally, too.  Actually, her name was “Edwina” but sometimes the name they give you is all wrong, so she asked to be called “Sally.”  I guess, if my name was “Edwina” I’d ask to be called Sally, too.  Sally looked ancient.  If you were traveling in an unsafe neighborhood with Sally as your companion, you could hide all your spending cash in the lines in her cheeks and no mugger would ever find it.  Her forehead creases looked like the ridge around a piecrust.  The fact that Sally weighed under a hundred pounds didn’t help her appearance much.  If you passed wind near her, she’d probably disintegrate; not to mention get a little indignant. \n	\nAt the nurses’ station, I asked all the appropriate questions, and some inappropriate questions, about the patient.  These included her last set of vitals, her overall disposition and, of course, her favorite color.  I never do anything with that information, I just like to know.  The charge nurse made a big deal about the fact that Edwina likes to be called “Sally.”  I asked why.\n	\n\n“Who knows?  Everybody likes to have a nickname,” the unit clerk said.\n	\n“You mean like ‘Whitey?’” I asked.  The unit clerk stared at me.  She was black.  Whoops.  “No, I mean—like Whitey Ford.  The baseball player.  Not—I mean—not, like… you know.”\n	\n“Cracker?” she offered.\n	\n“Right.  Not like that.”\n	\nThe transport was uneventful.  Sally, fortunately, was communicative, so that made it at least a little more interesting.  We were able to chat a bit about this and that; she was even somewhat coherent.  She told me that she used to be a first grade teacher.  For forty-six years.  I told her that Ali used to teach pre-school.  \n	\n“That’s a nice age,” Sally said.  I agreed.  I had met all of Ali’s students each of the three years she taught at a Quaker school.  I liked these kids.  It was a great age.  Much better, I hasten to add, than eighty-six.  If you asked Sally I’m sure she’d tell you so.\n	\n“Why do they call you ‘Sally’?” I asked, because there was a lull in the conversation.  Because I wanted to know.\n	\n“Everybody asks me that,” Sally said, smiling a crinkly smile.  “When I was a little girl, there was this popular song called ‘Pretty Little Blue Eyed Sally’.  That became my name.”  \n	\nAs an EMT, you don’t often look into patients’ eyes.  You look at their charts, you look at your paperwork, you look at their ankles for signs of edema, you look at their chest to make sure they’re breathing.  You watch their jugular vein pulsing in their neck to make sure blood’s still flowing.  If you look in their eyes, it’s a cursory glance to check pupil size and response, to make sure the patient isn’t stroked out or coked up.  You look in patients’ eyes, but you don’t look into them.  That’s too weird.  But, after Sally told me she got her nickname from a song called “Pretty Little Blue Eyed Sally,” I looked into her eyes.  Blue Topaz couldn’t hold a candle to these eyes.  It’s kind of a strange feeling, being twenty-six and saying that about a woman who’s sixty years your senior, but it’s true.  They were sharp and strong and clean and bold, and it required no stretch of the imagination whatsoever to put those eyes into the head of a precocious eight year old, or a coquettish sixteen year old, or a scholarly thirty-one year old, or a wizened sixty-five year old.  Uncomfortable, I looked away.  \n	\n“It must have been a nice song,” was the stupid thing I thought to say.\n	\n“Oh, yes,” she said.  “And so that became my name.  I never remembered the name Edwina until I started parochial school and the teacher called out ‘Edwina!’  Well, she was looking at me,” Sally said, in mock astonishment.  I smiled.  “I said, ‘That’s not my name.’  When I got home that day I told my mother, ‘I’m not going back to that dumb school—they didn’t even know my name.  My mother asked ‘What did they call you?’  ‘Edwina’ I said.”  She said it as if it were a curse word.  “‘That’s your name,’ my mother said.  Well, I didn’t know that.  I don’t especially like Edwina either.  So I go by Sally.”\n	\nWhen I got home from work that day I went to the computer and did a search for “Pretty Little Blue Eyed Sally”.  While I couldn’t find any song from that era with that exact title (she does have dementia after all) I was able to find two versions of the song “Blue Eyed Sally”, and the one that gave her the nickname that stuck for over half a century was either recorded by the duo of minstrel performer Al Bernard and ragtime legend Russell Robinson in 1926, or by Vic Meyers, a ukulele performer of the same vintage.  Regrettably, I wasn’t able to find any lyrics.  So the words “Pretty Little” aren’t in the title.  So what?  Maybe that’s how Edwina sees herself: as little.  As pretty.  As Sally.  And who am I to say anything about that anyway?\n	\nThere are still days when I get scared about going off the deep end and winding up in the Behavioral Health Unit myself.  I fret and fuss about whether it’s going to be Ali visiting me, slumped over in the glider or me visiting her, slumped over in the glider, or whether we’ll occupy the stain-resistant loveseat together, crapping ourselves and muttering about the nurses as we drool on each others’ sweater vests and hold gnarled hands, our orange blossom wedding bands barely clinging to our deteriorating fingers.  I don’t know what happened to Ben, the tennis-playing, book-devouring CEO, and I don’t know what happened to Sally or to Edwina, and I don’t know what’s going to happen to us.  I just hope that, when it comes time for me to go on the stretcher that the EMT in the back cares just enough to snoop through my file or look into my eyes to maybe find out who I was before I started on the way down.', 'On the Way Down by Gabriel L.

(612, 1, '2016-09-29 15:25:28', '2016-09-29 23:25:28', 'Sometimes the name they give you is all wrong.  My paternal grandmother’s name was Nava, which, in Hebrew, translates to “beautiful.”  In the biblical Song of Songs, it says, “Thou art beautiful [nava], O my love, as Tirzah, beautiful [nava] as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.”  By the time I met my Nava, she wasn’t quite beautiful, or terrible.  She was essentially a shriveled up little raisin in a modest, tweed skirt and thirty-five-year-old glasses.  She was certainly sweet and cute, and raisiny, but I’m not sure she was beautiful.  I suppose at one time she was—her husband certainly thought so anyway.  \r\nOne day my father and I were talking about names, for some reason, children’s names; what you name your children.  I asked him if, when my mother was pregnant with me, he’d ever brought up the idea with her about naming me after his own father.  He exploded at me.\\r\\n“Gabriel!  What are you, fuckin’ stupid?!” he asked, rhetorically, I hope. \r\n \r\n“Well, Dad, I mean, you…” I began.\\r\\n“Look Gabriel; having a child is a huge responsibility, okay?  You can really fuck a kid up right from the beginning if you call him the wrong thing,” my father explained to me.  I protested.\\r\\n“The ‘wrong thing?’  Dad, you know, he was your father.”\\r\\n“So?” he frothed.  “He’s still my father, and you are my son, and it’s a terrible name so why would I do it to you?  MoRAD?” he roared, punching out the last syllable each time like a veteran heavyweight.  “You think I wanted to name you MoRAD?!  Next you’ll say I should have named you after me.  Efraim,” he said contemptuously of his own identity.  “Another fuckin’ retard name!”\\r\\nMy father, finished for the time being, got up from the dining room table, randomly announced that he was going to “The Camera Shop” and left. \\r\\nI didn’t know what the hell was the matter with him.  His bombastic, Israeli rants are a product of the desert from which he came, and are just meant to be endured and accepted.  He blows up all the time, like a rear-ended Pinto, but locating the catalyst usually proves a superhuman investigative feat.  I didn’t figure this one out for a while.  \\r\\nA few days ago I was sitting on my wife’s futon leafing through her Hebrew/English Dictionary.  This is the type of book I’m pleased that she has because it is also the type of book I would never spend fifteen cents on myself but that I secretly find interesting.  I, like any mature, serious-minded beneficiary of higher education, immediately looked for the translations of the words “penis” and “vagina” only to be thoroughly disappointed that this particular dictionary did not even list words at all, though the editors did, apparently, believe earnestly that the translation for “abundant breasts” (khazeh) shofe’a was a pertinent and necessary inclusion.  I looked for the translations of our names.  There was nothing for Gabriel and there was nothing for Efraim.  Then I remembered.  Him.  MoRAD.  I turned to the “M’s” and there it was:\\r\\n<em>(ba) MORAD (adj.): “on the way down.”</em>\\r\\nI closed my eyes and put my hand to my head.  He was right.  My grandfather never had a chance.  He was fucked over, as my father had put it, right from the beginning.\\r\\nDespite Nava’s beautiful name and in-step with Morad’s pessimistic one, they both suffered gravely from a type of psychosis known as vascular dementia before they mercifully died.  They lived in Australia and I lived in Pennsylvania, so I never saw their pitiful and piteous decline and descent into the dark.  In fact, I never met my grandfather.  My grandmother I was fortunate enough to meet when she was still basically together.  Like I said, she was very small.  \\r\\nThe two of them fell ill and expired prior the beginning of my career as an Emergency Medical Technician.  Because of this, I suppose, my perspective on their illness was not one formed by repeated exposure to these kinds of psychological destructions, but was a raw, emotional and desperate view, the view of an uneducated boy losing his grandparents.  After their diagnoses, I watched my father peerlessly for signs of forgetfulness, inattention, listlessness, wandering and confusion.  Although I know now that vascular dementia is not hereditary, I watch for changes in my own mentality, too.  I worry when I feel my brain losing focus, glazing over or getting fuzzy about one thing or another.  Maybe I’ve just been an intellectually unstimulated EMT for too long.\\r\\nSince I’ve started this job and have seen all kinds of age-induced dementia, the thought of watching my own father lose his mind still petrifies me.  The thought of going crazy myself, however, I no longer find troublesome.  I read an article in a magazine just the other day about a physician who specialized in gerontology.  In his vast career, he had examined and diagnosed thousands of patients with Alzheimer’s.  Recently, he wrote, he had been having memory and attention lapses himself and, after these problems worsened, he self-diagnosed Alzheimer’s.  While he saw another physician to have his suspicions confirmed – which they were – he already knew.  Worse infinitely than knowing the diagnosis; he knew the future, his future, and it’s not pretty.  Anything that involves peeing yourself and failing to recognize your children never is.  \\r\\nThis physician, still in the beginning of his descent, wrote lucidly and placidly about the disease and its effects on the brain and on the body.  He talked wistfully about the damage it had started to do to him, and he was candid with the reader and with himself about what it still had left to do.  I envied him as much as you can envy anyone with Alzheimer’s because I wanted to be as at ease with Fate as he. But I wrestle with illness and death in the daylight and the dark and becoming an EMT in no way helped exorcise those demons.  In many ways, they made them all too real.  In the realm of Alzheimer’s and dementia, though, perhaps my experiences with the geriatric psychiatric patients served to allay some of my fears about insanity.  Many people would argue that dementia isn’t funny, and, of course, when it’s you dealing with the demented parent or spouse, it’s not.  However, from the detached view of the EMT on a psych transport, when your elderly, female patient is demanding that you stop the ambulance “in the name of the United States Government and the Continental Congress,” it’s difficult to keep a straight face in the moment, even though you’re confronting real human tragedy.  I hope that finding that funny doesn’t make me a monster; I hope it makes me human.\\r\\nAs I write this, the date of my marriage to Ali is a mere fifty-odd days away.  Approaching this date of sublime happiness, there is also an element of sadness.  We are melding two families, and both have a history of mental illness.  One or both of us could wind up losing it, and that is frightening to me.  The children that I hope to make with her could wind up losing it, too.  I have seen what happens to people when they lose it.  It gets, well, lost.  I think about our vows.  We vow to love each other and help each other through sickness and in health, through it all.  We promise to love and honor and respect each other no matter what.  But what happens when you pledge your love to someone eternally and then, one day; he or she is not that person anymore?\\r\\nBen was lying facedown on a small sofa at Macomb Hospital’s Behavioral Health Unit.  He was wearing a gray tracksuit, though it was highly unlikely that he was going to be participating in a marathon anytime soon.  His gray hair was strewn this way and that and it stuck to the pillowcase once he sat down on the stretcher.  He had bits of egg and what looked like syrup – at least, I hoped it was syrup – on his jacket front and crystallized eye-boogers encrusted his eyelids.  It was two fifteen and he’d probably been sleeping all day.  And why not?  Nothing else to do.  There was Scrabble in the Unit’s game-room, but I didn’t observe any potential companions that looked up to a Triple Word Score anymore than Ben did.\\r\\nWe were taking Ben to a very upscale facility that specialized in “eldercare” and so this piqued my interest a little bit.  I am a very nosey person and, when I know we’re taking someone to a retirement home that has a yearlong waiting list to get in, I want to know a little bit more about the individual we’re taking there.  Maybe he married money, maybe he’s a war profiteer, maybe he’s a former member of the Johnson administration; I just want to know, that’s all.  Because Ben didn’t speak to me, I could snoop through his file.  I had no compunction about doing this.  Occasionally there was something in there I actually needed to know.    \\r\\nThere was the usual bullshit: medications, allergies, lab results, safety checks, vital signs, nursing notes.  I usually skip all this if I’m reasonably sure the patient isn’t going to croak during the ride.  I flip and flip through the pages until I get to what I’m really after: the physician’s narrative report.  Ben’s physician’s report shocked me so much that I pulled out my journal and copied it verbatim.  Sue me.\\r\\n“Ben ****** is a seventy-six year old Caucasian male with advanced Alzeheimer’s-related dementia.  He is essentially non-verbal and is currently incontinent of bowel and bladder.  Born and raised in England, apparently he was very smart as a child and got a full scholarship to the Sorbonne University in Paris.  After he graduated, he became and engineer and eventually came to the United States in the 1950s and became a Chief Executive for a company.  The patient retired when he was 60, at the beginning of his dementia.  The patient used to enjoy playing tennis and reading books.  Apparently at one time he could read forty books in one week which is, of course, quite an achievement.”    \\r\\nNow going two hours without soiling himself would be “quite an achievement” for Ben.  I became deeply depressed after reading, and copying, the physician’s narrative.  The report went on to say that Ben’s wife was “quite active and independent”.  I wondered briefly how exactly that was relevant and it annoyed me that the physician had put that in there, almost as if to mock Ben and his deplorable mental condition.  I surmised that the doctor who wrote the report was probably schtupping Ben’s wife.  I resented being exposed to this information and paranoid fantasy.  I felt ugly, like an intruder, like this was something nobody was supposed to know.  Now, of course, that I knew what he had been and now that I knew what he had become, I wanted to know more and more and more.  I wanted to know about the first moment double-breasted, pinstriped Ben fucked up in the office or at a high-power meeting.  I want to know the first time he looked at Bob but said, “Jim”.  I wanted to know the first time the phone rang and he answered the stapler.  How did this Goliath get taken down?  By a little neurological atrophy?  It didn’t seem possible.  If it got Ben, if it got Reagan, if it got my Morad and Nava…  \r\n	\r\nIt got Sally, too.  Actually, her name was “Edwina” but sometimes the name they give you is all wrong, so she asked to be called “Sally.”  I guess, if my name was “Edwina” I’d ask to be called Sally, too.  Sally looked ancient.  If you were traveling in an unsafe neighborhood with Sally as your companion, you could hide all your spending cash in the lines in her cheeks and no mugger would ever find it.  Her forehead creases looked like the ridge around a piecrust.  The fact that Sally weighed under a hundred pounds didn’t help her appearance much.  If you passed wind near her, she’d probably disintegrate; not to mention get a little indignant. \r\n	\r\nAt the nurses’ station, I asked all the appropriate questions, and some inappropriate questions, about the patient.  These included her last set of vitals, her overall disposition and, of course, her favorite color.  I never do anything with that information, I just like to know.  The charge nurse made a big deal about the fact that Edwina likes to be called “Sally.”  I asked why.\r\n	\\r\\n“Who knows?  Everybody likes to have a nickname,” the unit clerk said.\r\n	\r\n“You mean like ‘Whitey?’” I asked.  The unit clerk stared at me.  She was black.  Whoops.  “No, I mean—like Whitey Ford.  The baseball player.  Not—I mean—not, like… you know.”\r\n	\r\n“Cracker?” she offered.\r\n	\r\n“Right.  Not like that.”\r\n	\r\nThe transport was uneventful.  Sally, fortunately, was communicative, so that made it at least a little more interesting.  We were able to chat a bit about this and that; she was even somewhat coherent.  She told me that she used to be a first grade teacher.  For forty-six years.  I told her that Ali used to teach pre-school.  \r\n	\r\n“That’s a nice age,” Sally said.  I agreed.  I had met all of Ali’s students each of the three years she taught at a Quaker school.  I liked these kids.  It was a great age.  Much better, I hasten to add, than eighty-six.  If you asked Sally I’m sure she’d tell you so.\r\n	\r\n“Why do they call you ‘Sally’?” I asked, because there was a lull in the conversation.  Because I wanted to know.\r\n	\r\n“Everybody asks me that,” Sally said, smiling a crinkly smile.  “When I was a little girl, there was this popular song called ‘Pretty Little Blue Eyed Sally’.  That became my name.”  \r\n	\r\nAs an EMT, you don’t often look into patients’ eyes.  You look at their charts, you look at your paperwork, you look at their ankles for signs of edema, you look at their chest to make sure they’re breathing.  You watch their jugular vein pulsing in their neck to make sure blood’s still flowing.  If you look in their eyes, it’s a cursory glance to check pupil size and response, to make sure the patient isn’t stroked out or coked up.  You look in patients’ eyes, but you don’t look into them.  That’s too weird.  But, after Sally told me she got her nickname from a song called “Pretty Little Blue Eyed Sally,” I looked into her eyes.  Blue Topaz couldn’t hold a candle to these eyes.  It’s kind of a strange feeling, being twenty-six and saying that about a woman who’s sixty years your senior, but it’s true.  They were sharp and strong and clean and bold, and it required no stretch of the imagination whatsoever to put those eyes into the head of a precocious eight year old, or a coquettish sixteen year old, or a scholarly thirty-one year old, or a wizened sixty-five year old.  Uncomfortable, I looked away.  \r\n	\r\n“It must have been a nice song,” was the stupid thing I thought to say.\r\n	\r\n“Oh, yes,” she said.  “And so that became my name.  I never remembered the name Edwina until I started parochial school and the teacher called out ‘Edwina!’  Well, she was looking at me,” Sally said, in mock astonishment.  I smiled.  “I said, ‘That’s not my name.’  When I got home that day I told my mother, ‘I’m not going back to that dumb school—they didn’t even know my name.  My mother asked ‘What did they call you?’  ‘Edwina’ I said.”  She said it as if it were a curse word.  “‘That’s your name,’ my mother said.  Well, I didn’t know that.  I don’t especially like Edwina either.  So I go by Sally.”\r\n	\r\nWhen I got home from work that day I went to the computer and did a search for “Pretty Little Blue Eyed Sally”.  While I couldn’t find any song from that era with that exact title (she does have dementia after all) I was able to find two versions of the song “Blue Eyed Sally”, and the one that gave her the nickname that stuck for over half a century was either recorded by the duo of minstrel performer Al Bernard and ragtime legend Russell Robinson in 1926, or by Vic Meyers, a ukulele performer of the same vintage.  Regrettably, I wasn’t able to find any lyrics.  So the words “Pretty Little” aren’t in the title.  So what?  Maybe that’s how Edwina sees herself: as little.  As pretty.  As Sally.  And who am I to say anything about that anyway?\r\n	\r\nThere are still days when I get scared about going off the deep end and winding up in the Behavioral Health Unit myself.  I fret and fuss about whether it’s going to be Ali visiting me, slumped over in the glider or me visiting her, slumped over in the glider, or whether we’ll occupy the stain-resistant loveseat together, crapping ourselves and muttering about the nurses as we drool on each others’ sweater vests and hold gnarled hands, our orange blossom wedding bands barely clinging to our deteriorating fingers.  I don’t know what happened to Ben, the tennis-playing, book-devouring CEO, and I don’t know what happened to Sally or to Edwina, and I don’t know what’s going to happen to us.  I just hope that, when it comes time for me to go on the stretcher that the EMT in the back cares just enough to snoop through my file or look into my eyes to maybe find out who I was before I started on the way down. \\r\\n<em>Gabriel Nathan is an Emergency Medical Technician who worked for a private, for-profit ambulance company that contracted with hospitals and other facilities to transport, among others, patients with emotional disturbances.

(613, 1, '2016-09-29 15:29:45', '2016-09-29 23:29:45', 'The banquet room was dark and crowded.  The walls stood dim and abyssal, wrapped in waves of glossy fabric cascading across the rippled periphery, ocean blue and glacial, like the walls of ice box covered in cold satin, glazed in indigo. \n\nMaggie, noticing that her reception was enjoyable for all in attendance, and having just arrived from the ceremony, made herself look in the direction of Paul, who since the service had been sitting in the corner of the clubhouse’s dining room at a table draped in power blue tablecloth.  He was talking to a girl with blonde hair, her breast welled-up tight and cleaved taut above a push-up bra, like twin canned hams, catching the errant attentions of several young men not bothered enough to look into her eyes.  Paul’s posture was lax, shoulder blades pressed against the back rest of the chair in which he slouched, legs crossed beneath the smoke slowly streaming off the end of a cigarette he held away from his face like a dirty diaper.  Maggie turned and inhaled as deeply as her tight corset would allow, and then, squinting her eyes, looked around the room at the lively swarm of guests she had invited to celebrate her marriage.  \n\nShe paused for a moment, then instinctively, she turned to where Paul sat, puffing and chatting with the blonde, watching the guests on the shiny, lacquered dance floor in the middle of the room.\n\n“Why hello,” Maggie said, grabbing Paul’s wrist.  “Get up,” she said.  “I want you to dance with me.”\n\n“Hello there. And why is that?” he said, bashfully, having been caught off-guard.  \n\n“Oh, because – you look so handsome.” And Paul rose, offering no resistance as he followed her from the table to the dance floor across the room, at the same time managing to quickly milk the remaining embers from his smoke before stashing the butt on the tray of empty champagne glasses, all in stride. \n\nIt was warm on the dance floor beneath the florescent spotlights of blue and white.  Maggie turned and met Paul’s hands.  They held one another at arm’s length.  \n\n“Paul, honey,” Maggie said, “Thank you so much for being here.  It means a lot that you came.”\n\n“Nonsense.  I wouldn’t even think of being anywhere else,” said Paul, trying to pick-up the rhythm of Maggie’s sway as she led.  “I’m terribly happy for you and – besides – it’s good to see you.”  \n\n“I know and I’m glad,” she replied, attempting to focus on his words. “It has been so long.”  Their voices were distorted, drowned out by the music ringing off the stage and the relentless chatter of the surrounding guests.\n\n“Jack is so good to me.  He’s a friend of Ray Dempsey,” Maggie said.\n\n“I don’t know him that well,” Paul replied modestly.  She didn’t respond.\n\nAfter only a brief minute into their promenade, the music stopped.  The band graciously nodded to the crowd before leaving the stage and the heavy dance floor dispersed as the guests left in search of something to drink.  Only a few lingered.\n  \n“Well, I think I should make the rounds – thank people,” Maggie said.\n\n“Hold on for a second,” said Paul.  “Give yourself a moment.”\n\n“So, since when have you become friendly with Mr. Dempsey?” he asked.\n\n“Since awhile.  Since Jack and I started dating,” said Maggie.  “He’s a great guy, don’t you think?”\n\n“I suppose he’s alright.  I don’t know him very well.  Never associated with him and that crowd.  They were ahead of my time, you could say.”\n\n“Oh, yes.  Well, I couldn’t remember,” she said, looking around.  “I really ought to thank some people.”\n\n“Yeah, well, I remember him.  Slow down.  The party’s not even kicked-off,” said Paul.  “Talk to me a while before your new hubby whisks you away.”\n\n“My what?”  \n\n“Your hubby – your husband.  You’ll have the rest of the evening to thank people.”    \n\n“Of course,” said Maggie.  “But everyone is eating now and with everyone seated – honestly – I ought to say hello.”\n\n“But I’m your old friend who has traveled far to be here and –.”\n\n“I know, but—.”\n\n“Where did you meet this boy anyways?” he chimed in quickly.\n\nMaggie conceded and smirked amorously at Paul who was grinning back in anticipation of her reply.  Suddenly, from the corner of the room, the blonde girl shrieked with laughter as two college boys circled like sharks on either side of her, joking with one another, gazing deeply into her chest.  Maggie watched her.\n\n“I said where did you meet this boy?”\n\n“Oh, we met last year, through mutual friends,” she said.  “He begged me to marry him until I finally agreed.  You know the story.”\n\n“Well, what I mean is, what did he do to – how do you say – win your over?”\n\n“Gosh.  I don’t know, Paul.  I suppose he made me feel important. I fell in love.”\n\nAgain, the blonde chirped hysterically, basking in the boozy attention she was collecting. \n\n“Love, huh.  Well, you’ve fallen in then?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Love,” he echoed the processed answer she proposed.\n\n“I married him.”  \n\n“Of course, why wouldn’t you?”\n\n“Oh. It’s not that,” said Maggie, detecting the condescension in Paul’s tone.  “It’s that I felt…that he made me feel like the only girl on the planet – made me feel that no one else could ever make me feel that way.”\n\n“Ah – I see.  That sounds a bit odd.”\n\nShe paused, dwelling on his remark, unsure of how it was intended.\n\n“What does that mean?” she asked.\n\n“I said that sounds odd, if you ask me.  But I imagine it’s a difficult thing to explain.”\n\n“It is.” She stated this confidently.\n\n“So – How did he do it?”\n\nCackles sprang-up once more from the blonde.  Maggie focused on her, avoiding eye contact with Paul who, in the middle of his flirtatious interrogation, had grown less aware of the activity fluttering around him.   \n\n“What?” she said.\n\n“I asked – how did the man propose?”\n\n“Oh, I don’t remember.  He did it the way people do.”\n\n“Well – that strikes me as odd as well.” \n\n“And why is that?”\n\n“That is because I imagine it’s a moment that a bride would remember more intimately.  That’s all.  Don’t you think?”\n\n“I think that every bride is different,” she said.\n\n“Who are you looking at anyways?” Paul said, glancing over his shoulder.  “What’s so fascinating over there?”\n\n“No one,” Maggie said.  “Nothing.  I believe I need something to drink.”\n\n“Well, well. That’s the best idea I’ve heard all day,” he replied enthusiastically.\n\nPaul gently touched her arm at the elbow and steered her around in the direction of the wet bar.  The motion appealed to him and, with her assent, it felt all the more natural.  They walked single-file through the congested dining room.  Maggie followed him through the surrounding crowd. \n\n“Make way everyone!  Make way.  The bride would like something to drink,” he announced.\n\nThe line of guests parted and made way for Paul who ordered two drinks.\n\n“I think,” Maggie said into his ear, “I’ll get some air on the terrace.  It’s stuffy in here, anyways.  Too many bodies.”\n\n“Alright. I’m following you,” he replied.\n\nThey walked towards the glass door to the terrace.  Maggie led the way, rearranging her bangs in its transparent reflection before the door was opened by the porter who had stood in the same place all evening, acting when called upon  Paul followed, carrying a glass of seltzer water in one hand and a scotch in the other.\n\nThe terrace was empty.  Several citronella candles lined the railing of the deck which overlooked the eighteenth hole of the club’s golf course.  It was daylight still and the contrast between the dead Bermuda grass of the fairway and the lush of the putting green was noticeable.  Maggie was immediately aware of the cool air on her skin as she stepped out into the autumn air.  She listened to the muted volume of the noisy guest pilfering around inside through the building’s brick exterior.  It was cold, but she walked across the terrace, leaned casually on the iron banister, and inhaled deeply through her nostrils before turning to look at Paul behind her.\n\n“Here is your drink, Madame,” Paul said, handing her the glass of seltzer.  She drank it quickly.\n\n“Goodness...doesn’t it feel so much better out here?  Just feel the air.”\n\n“Certainly does,” Paul said, after a sip of his drink.  He exhaled with his mouth open, as if to broadcast his refreshment.  \n\nThey stood quietly for several moments and surveyed the manicured landscape below.\n\n“Can you hear that?” Maggie said.  “The band is back on stage.”\n\n“Yes, I can.  Maybe they’ll play something good this time.”  He walked over to the window and peered in.  Maggie watched him.  By the soft light of the citronella, she saw him cup his free hand around his eyes to cut down the refraction of his reflection on the glass.\n\n“Nope,” he said over his shoulder.  “It’s the same ol’shit.”  He laughed.  \n\n“Oh please.  It’s not that bad.  Come here a minute.”\n\nHe walked over to where she stood.  They listened to the sound of band’s guitar.  \n\n“What is it?” he asked.\n\nShe paused, beaming, looking relaxed, while gazing out at the amber and gold leaves of the trees lining the fairway.\n\n“Just feel how nice it is out here,” Maggie said.\n\n“Yes, we’ve already gone over this.”\n\n“I know, you jerk.”\n\n“Now why am I a jerk?”\n\n“Some people, ah-hem,” she said, “are too sarcastic for their own good.”\n\n“Oh.  I see.”\n\n“I’m sure you do.  How would you like it if someone mocked everything you said?”\n\n“Not sure, really.  Never happened,” Paul said with a feigned arrogance that made her smile. \n\n“Well, I think it would drive you insane.”\n\n“I don’t think so.  I think I could take them on if it came to it.  Besides – I’m mad enough as it is.”\n\nHe swallowed another weighted mouthful from his glass and watched the hot flames of the candles dance above their Palmolive-colored wicks in the outdoor air.  \n\n“So what do you do when you back come home, anyways?” Maggie asked.  \n\n“You mean besides attending other people’s weddings?”\n\n“I saw that one coming,” she said, almost lightly.  “Yes, beside that.”\n\n“Indeed.  I don’t know really – spend time with the family, I suppose.  And they spend money on me.”\n\n“Mmm…That must be nice.”\n\n“It is.” \n\n“You know,” Maggie began, “It’s nice to have you back.  I’ve missed our talks.  Have you ever though about moving back?”\n\n“I do from time to time.  But I’ve outgrown the place, the people, you know.”\n\n“Oh come on,” she said.  “I know you miss all of us.”\n\n“Of course I do,” he replied, wondering who us was.  \n\nThey stood in silence.  \n\n“You want to know something,” Maggie said suddenly, “you remind me of one of those old western movies, of one of those cowboys who rides into town when there’s trouble happening.  You know.  Sets things straight, then rides off into one of those hazy purple sunsets, guitar music and everything.”\n\n“Oh yeah?\n\n“Ha – like some outlaw.  Good grief!  What am I saying?”\n\n“What’s the matter with that?  Those men are heroes, aren’t they? ”\n\n“Nothing at all.  Only you can’t forget: that sort cowboy never really wins.  He never gets rich.  He rides off alone, wanders around the desert like some nomad with a horse.  And, well, he never looks that happy.”\n\n“Yeah,” said Paul, “Well, let’s not worry about John Wayne – or his horse.  Let’s have our drinks and enjoy this air that you’ve been talking so intensely about.”\n\n“I don’t believe I have anything left.  I chugged it all down, I think,” she said, holding her glass up to her eye-line examining it.  \n\n“No worries, I still have mine.”  He smiled and leaned on the banister with his elbows, dug into his pocket for his cigarette case, drew one from under the metal clip, tapped it out, and lit it on the nearest citronella.  He took a heavy drag, listening to the paper crackle beneath his nose.  He remarked that it was, in fact, a beautiful night, that it was good to be home, and that he would be sad to leave the following day.  He finished his cigarette and flicked it over the railing.   \n\nMaggie noticed the angle of his brow hanging down as it curled dully above his tired eyes, revealing his inebriation.  She recalled how familiar his expression was.    \n\n“So,” Maggie began, watching Paul, waiting for him to finish his ritual, “when did you begin to smoke, huh?”\n\n“At about nine – ten o’clock this morning,” he replied.  “That’s usually when I begin.”\n\n“Uh-huh.  I should have seen that one coming as well.  You know, that’s terribly bad for you. And it’s disgusting.”\n\n“Terribly bad?  I rather think it’s terribly good,” he said sharply, attempting to deflect attention, as he always has, away from himself.\n\n“So Mrs. Jack Ethridge – how does it feel to be married?”\n\n“Well – it’s a relief, I suppose.  He wonderful man, owns his own business, a printing company, simply adores me.”\n\n“He’s quite older than you, Maggie, isn’t he?” he said.  His tone, uneven and rhetorical.  \n\n“Oh, let’s drop that business, Paul.  You know me.  I hate looking at people in terms of such things.  I’m happy.  He makes me happy.  What else could matter?”\n\n“Yes. Well, I hate to put my two cents in – especially when I’m not that well acquainted with the parties involved – only it seems to me that – not to say the man is old, but rather, you’re so young.  After all, I mean.”\n\n“I’m not young,” said Maggie.  “I’m certainly old enough to love and marry whomever I choose.”  \n\n“Love,” Paul repeated, his eyes fixing themselves on the fairway.  “I guess love is an attractive thing to be in.  I wouldn’t know.  I think I would like the term better if people used it a little more sparingly.  I mean – to me anyways – it always sounds a bit artificial when you hear it branded about so – what’s the word – leisurely.  I don’t know.  I could be wrong.  Everyone says it, I suppose.  Geez.  I can only imagine this predatorily desire people have to use the word on any ol’inanimate thing.  You know me.  I honestly don’t think I could ever do so in such a way, when I come right down to it.  But you know.  Some people are made for it.  You’re not the only one!   I even think hubby is one himself.”\n\n“Who?” said Maggie.\n\n“Who do you think?”\n\n“Jack?  Mmm, I guess.  I think Jack grew out of that phase a long time ago.  Not to say he doesn’t love me.  We really don’t say it.  Well, not everyday.  At the right times and stuff.  He always manages to tell me one way or another.  Or shows me somehow.”\n\n“I thought he adores you, this man,” Paul said.  \n\n“I don’t understand,” she replied. \n\n“Ah – I’ll let it go.  I’d rather not talk about it on such an important night of yours.  It’s just odd to me.  That’s all.”\n\n“Oh,” said Maggie, emphatic and defensive.\n\n“I’m not a jerk or anything.  I don’t know.  Maybe I am.  I just have my own thoughts and – in my silly little way – I try to express them.  The best I can, anyways.”\n\nHe leaned in towards her, as if to reach out at the smoldered ash of a dead campfire, feeling for heat where it once had been but no longer is: smokeless, dark, and without warmth.  \n\n“Look,” said Maggie.  “It’s time I finally thanked the –.”\n\nPaul said, “It isn’t that I can’t appreciate how one person feels when they decide to get hitched – or whatever – and plan to spend the rest of their lives together, have children, buy a minivan and all.  I mean, I can understand.  He makes you feel that.  I guess I’m just not built that way.  It always has had to be different with me.  Before, you know.  I mean, love and all.”\n\nMaggie had listened with restraint and, she believed, with politeness, but the persistence with which he handled the subject in the manner that he did wore her patience away.\n\n“Look, I really must get inside.  I have to greet my guests who must think I’m incredibly rude by this point.  Goodness, I should have been in there before the band began playing again.  So I think I’ll go inside and be a good hostess.”\n\n“Of course,” Paul said.  He relented.  “Go ahead.”\n\n“Are you coming?”\n\n“In a minute, Mrs. Etheridge. Go ahead.”\n\n“Ok.  See you in there,” Maggie said.\n\n“Alright, and…” he paused, “congratulations.”\n\nShe smiled back.  He pretended to return it.\n\nPaul watched her disappear through the glass door then slowly turned to lean on the railing.  It saddened him, he thought, that she was no different from any other American girl her age and he felt disappointed in her for behaving the only way she was expected to, for sticking to the script that the world had written for her.  Cradling his empty glass in his hand, he gave it a single shake, and listened to the remaining ice cubes rattle together.  He took out another cigarette and placed it between his lips.  \n\nInside, the music subsided.  Someone at the microphone asked the guests to welcome Mr. and Mrs. Jack Ethridge.  Everyone clapped as the couple made their way to the empty dance floor.  The cheers roared-up before bottoming out and male singer began a ballad to which the couple danced.  All the guests watched in amorous admiration.  Several whistles cut though the song and the room filled with the flashing of cameras.\n\nWhen Paul finished his cigarette, he went inside.  He walked quickly through the crowd entranced by the dance floor spectacle, directly to the wet bar where the bartender had taken advantage of an opportune break to tidy up his station and replenish his stock.  Paul remained there for almost twenty minutes, listening to the band.   \n\nSoon, when it came time for the newly weds to leave, the entire party congregated outside the front entrance of the clubhouse where a horse and buggy was parked, waiting to take the couple away.  Paul followed the crowd outside, looking on from the periphery.  He sat down on a wooden bench behind the cluster of people.  No one had taken it.  He watched the couple gather at the mouth of the door.  The crowd applauded and gave their final regards.  Paul saw what he could from his position in brief glimpses through the gaps of people bunched together, throwing confetti and waving streamers.  The couple mounted the carriage and embarked, waving gratefully to their cheerful onlookers.  When the buggy pulled away, a few guests waited on the curb to watch the couple as they rode away.  \n\nPaul remained seated and listened to the sound of the horse’s shoed-hooves click across the pavement.  The sound grew softer as it moved away in the autumn evening, off into a hazy purple sunset.  The music was gone.

(615, 1, '2016-09-29 15:31:55', '2016-09-29 23:31:55', 'The banquet room was dark and crowded.  The walls stood dim and abyssal, wrapped in waves of glossy fabric cascading across the rippled periphery, ocean blue and glacial, like the walls of ice box covered in cold satin, glazed in indigo. \\r\\nMaggie, noticing that her reception was enjoyable for all in attendance, and having just arrived from the ceremony, made herself look in the direction of Paul, who since the service had been sitting in the corner of the clubhouse’s dining room at a table draped in power blue tablecloth.  He was talking to a girl with blonde hair, her breast welled-up tight and cleaved taut above a push-up bra, like twin canned hams, catching the errant attentions of several young men not bothered enough to look into her eyes.  Paul’s posture was lax, shoulder blades pressed against the back rest of the chair in which he slouched, legs crossed beneath the smoke slowly streaming off the end of a cigarette he held away from his face like a dirty diaper.  Maggie turned and inhaled as deeply as her tight corset would allow, and then, squinting her eyes, looked around the room at the lively swarm of guests she had invited to celebrate her marriage.  \\r\\nShe paused for a moment, then instinctively, she turned to where Paul sat, puffing and chatting with the blonde, watching the guests on the shiny, lacquered dance floor in the middle of the room.\\r\\n“Why hello,” Maggie said, grabbing Paul’s wrist.  “Get up,” she said.  “I want you to dance with me.”\\r\\n“Hello there. And why is that?” he said, bashfully, having been caught off-guard.  \\r\\n“Oh, because – you look so handsome.” And Paul rose, offering no resistance as he followed her from the table to the dance floor across the room, at the same time managing to quickly milk the remaining embers from his smoke before stashing the butt on the tray of empty champagne glasses, all in stride. \\r\\nIt was warm on the dance floor beneath the florescent spotlights of blue and white.  Maggie turned and met Paul’s hands.  They held one another at arm’s length.  \\r\\n“Paul, honey,” Maggie said, “Thank you so much for being here.  It means a lot that you came.”\\r\\n“Nonsense.  I wouldn’t even think of being anywhere else,” said Paul, trying to pick-up the rhythm of Maggie’s sway as she led.  “I’m terribly happy for you and – besides – it’s good to see you.”  \\r\\n“I know and I’m glad,” she replied, attempting to focus on his words. “It has been so long.”  Their voices were distorted, drowned out by the music ringing off the stage and the relentless chatter of the surrounding guests.\\r\\n“Jack is so good to me.  He’s a friend of Ray Dempsey,” Maggie said.\\r\\n“I don’t know him that well,” Paul replied modestly.  She didn’t respond.\\r\\nAfter only a brief minute into their promenade, the music stopped.  The band graciously nodded to the crowd before leaving the stage and the heavy dance floor dispersed as the guests left in search of something to drink.  Only a few lingered.\r\n  \r\n“Well, I think I should make the rounds – thank people,” Maggie said.\\r\\n“Hold on for a second,” said Paul.  “Give yourself a moment.”\\r\\n“So, since when have you become friendly with Mr. Dempsey?” he asked.\\r\\n“Since awhile.  Since Jack and I started dating,” said Maggie.  “He’s a great guy, don’t you think?”\\r\\n“I suppose he’s alright.  I don’t know him very well.  Never associated with him and that crowd.  They were ahead of my time, you could say.”\\r\\n“Oh, yes.  Well, I couldn’t remember,” she said, looking around.  “I really ought to thank some people.”\\r\\n“Yeah, well, I remember him.  Slow down.  The party’s not even kicked-off,” said Paul.  “Talk to me a while before your new hubby whisks you away.”\\r\\n“My what?”  \\r\\n“Your hubby – your husband.  You’ll have the rest of the evening to thank people.”    \\r\\n“Of course,” said Maggie.  “But everyone is eating now and with everyone seated – honestly – I ought to say hello.”\\r\\n“But I’m your old friend who has traveled far to be here and –.”\\r\\n“I know, but—.”\\r\\n“Where did you meet this boy anyways?” he chimed in quickly.\\r\\nMaggie conceded and smirked amorously at Paul who was grinning back in anticipation of her reply.  Suddenly, from the corner of the room, the blonde girl shrieked with laughter as two college boys circled like sharks on either side of her, joking with one another, gazing deeply into her chest.  Maggie watched her.\\r\\n“I said where did you meet this boy?”\\r\\n“Oh, we met last year, through mutual friends,” she said.  “He begged me to marry him until I finally agreed.  You know the story.”\\r\\n“Well, what I mean is, what did he do to – how do you say – win your over?”\\r\\n“Gosh.  I don’t know, Paul.  I suppose he made me feel important. I fell in love.”\\r\\nAgain, the blonde chirped hysterically, basking in the boozy attention she was collecting. \\r\\n“Love, huh.  Well, you’ve fallen in then?”\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n“Love,” he echoed the processed answer she proposed.\\r\\n“I married him.”  \\r\\n“Of course, why wouldn’t you?”\\r\\n“Oh. It’s not that,” said Maggie, detecting the condescension in Paul’s tone.  “It’s that I felt…that he made me feel like the only girl on the planet – made me feel that no one else could ever make me feel that way.”\\r\\n“Ah – I see.  That sounds a bit odd.”\\r\\nShe paused, dwelling on his remark, unsure of how it was intended.\\r\\n“What does that mean?” she asked.\\r\\n“I said that sounds odd, if you ask me.  But I imagine it’s a difficult thing to explain.”\\r\\n“It is.” She stated this confidently.\\r\\n“So – How did he do it?”\\r\\nCackles sprang-up once more from the blonde.  Maggie focused on her, avoiding eye contact with Paul who, in the middle of his flirtatious interrogation, had grown less aware of the activity fluttering around him.   \\r\\n“What?” she said.\\r\\n“I asked – how did the man propose?”\\r\\n“Oh, I don’t remember.  He did it the way people do.”\\r\\n“Well – that strikes me as odd as well.” \\r\\n“And why is that?”\\r\\n“That is because I imagine it’s a moment that a bride would remember more intimately.  That’s all.  Don’t you think?”\\r\\n“I think that every bride is different,” she said.\\r\\n“Who are you looking at anyways?” Paul said, glancing over his shoulder.  “What’s so fascinating over there?”\\r\\n“No one,” Maggie said.  “Nothing.  I believe I need something to drink.”\\r\\n“Well, well. That’s the best idea I’ve heard all day,” he replied enthusiastically.\\r\\nPaul gently touched her arm at the elbow and steered her around in the direction of the wet bar.  The motion appealed to him and, with her assent, it felt all the more natural.  They walked single-file through the congested dining room.  Maggie followed him through the surrounding crowd. \\r\\n“Make way everyone!  Make way.  The bride would like something to drink,” he announced.\\r\\nThe line of guests parted and made way for Paul who ordered two drinks.\\r\\n“I think,” Maggie said into his ear, “I’ll get some air on the terrace.  It’s stuffy in here, anyways.  Too many bodies.”\\r\\n“Alright. I’m following you,” he replied.\\r\\nThey walked towards the glass door to the terrace.  Maggie led the way, rearranging her bangs in its transparent reflection before the door was opened by the porter who had stood in the same place all evening, acting when called upon  Paul followed, carrying a glass of seltzer water in one hand and a scotch in the other.\\r\\nThe terrace was empty.  Several citronella candles lined the railing of the deck which overlooked the eighteenth hole of the club’s golf course.  It was daylight still and the contrast between the dead Bermuda grass of the fairway and the lush of the putting green was noticeable.  Maggie was immediately aware of the cool air on her skin as she stepped out into the autumn air.  She listened to the muted volume of the noisy guest pilfering around inside through the building’s brick exterior.  It was cold, but she walked across the terrace, leaned casually on the iron banister, and inhaled deeply through her nostrils before turning to look at Paul behind her.\\r\\n“Here is your drink, Madame,” Paul said, handing her the glass of seltzer.  She drank it quickly.\\r\\n“Goodness...doesn’t it feel so much better out here?  Just feel the air.”\\r\\n“Certainly does,” Paul said, after a sip of his drink.  He exhaled with his mouth open, as if to broadcast his refreshment.  \\r\\nThey stood quietly for several moments and surveyed the manicured landscape below.\\r\\n“Can you hear that?” Maggie said.  “The band is back on stage.”\\r\\n“Yes, I can.  Maybe they’ll play something good this time.”  He walked over to the window and peered in.  Maggie watched him.  By the soft light of the citronella, she saw him cup his free hand around his eyes to cut down the refraction of his reflection on the glass.\\r\\n“Nope,” he said over his shoulder.  “It’s the same ol’shit.”  He laughed.  \\r\\n“Oh please.  It’s not that bad.  Come here a minute.”\\r\\nHe walked over to where she stood.  They listened to the sound of band’s guitar.  \\r\\n“What is it?” he asked.\\r\\nShe paused, beaming, looking relaxed, while gazing out at the amber and gold leaves of the trees lining the fairway.\\r\\n“Just feel how nice it is out here,” Maggie said.\\r\\n“Yes, we’ve already gone over this.”\\r\\n“I know, you jerk.”\\r\\n“Now why am I a jerk?”\\r\\n“Some people, ah-hem,” she said, “are too sarcastic for their own good.”\\r\\n“Oh.  I see.”\\r\\n“I’m sure you do.  How would you like it if someone mocked everything you said?”\\r\\n“Not sure, really.  Never happened,” Paul said with a feigned arrogance that made her smile. \\r\\n“Well, I think it would drive you insane.”\\r\\n“I don’t think so.  I think I could take them on if it came to it.  Besides – I’m mad enough as it is.”\\r\\nHe swallowed another weighted mouthful from his glass and watched the hot flames of the candles dance above their Palmolive-colored wicks in the outdoor air.  \\r\\n“So what do you do when you back come home, anyways?” Maggie asked.  \\r\\n“You mean besides attending other people’s weddings?”\\r\\n“I saw that one coming,” she said, almost lightly.  “Yes, beside that.”\\r\\n“Indeed.  I don’t know really – spend time with the family, I suppose.  And they spend money on me.”\\r\\n“Mmm…That must be nice.”\\r\\n“It is.” \\r\\n“You know,” Maggie began, “It’s nice to have you back.  I’ve missed our talks.  Have you ever though about moving back?”\\r\\n“I do from time to time.  But I’ve outgrown the place, the people, you know.”\\r\\n“Oh come on,” she said.  “I know you miss all of us.”\\r\\n“Of course I do,” he replied, wondering who us was.  \\r\\nThey stood in silence.  \\r\\n“You want to know something,” Maggie said suddenly, “you remind me of one of those old western movies, of one of those cowboys who rides into town when there’s trouble happening.

He rides off alone, wanders around the desert like some nomad with a horse.  And, well, he never looks that happy.”\\r\\n“Yeah,” said Paul, “Well, let’s not worry about John Wayne – or his horse.  Let’s have our drinks and enjoy this air that you’ve been talking so intensely about.”\\r\\n“I don’t believe I have anything left.  I chugged it all down, I think,” she said, holding her glass up to her eye-line examining it.  \\r\\n“No worries, I still have mine.”  He smiled and leaned on the banister with his elbows, dug into his pocket for his cigarette case, drew one from under the metal clip, tapped it out, and lit it on the nearest citronella.  He took a heavy drag, listening to the paper crackle beneath his nose.  He remarked that it was, in fact, a beautiful night, that it was good to be home, and that he would be sad to leave the following day.  He finished his cigarette and flicked it over the railing.   \\r\\nMaggie noticed the angle of his brow hanging down as it curled dully above his tired eyes, revealing his inebriation.  She recalled how familiar his expression was.    \\r\\n“So,” Maggie began, watching Paul, waiting for him to finish his ritual, “when did you begin to smoke, huh?”\\r\\n“At about nine – ten o’clock this morning,” he replied.  “That’s usually when I begin.”\\r\\n“Uh-huh.  I should have seen that one coming as well.  You know, that’s terribly bad for you. And it’s disgusting.”\\r\\n“Terribly bad?

(649, 1, '2016-10-12 15:46:39', '2016-10-12 23:46:39', 'The sun was hot. That summer was a scorcher. I remember the sweat trickling down the sides of my face. I was always sticky and grubby – I spent most of my time outdoors playing with my new friend. We went to the park, played in my back garden, and roamed the local vacant land – a very mysterious and lonely place when you’re nine years old. \n\nThe little plot was quiet and still – like a forgotten, empty writing book left over from school. It was close to home – I could see the roof of my house – and yet it was so different. There was a wild tangle all over it’s surface – a strange mix of fast growing weeds and the more familiar garden plants my mother grew at home. It felt like another country – but just around the corner from home; very handy when you wanted to play pretend.\n\nThat day we were intrepid explorers, bent on a secret mission to save – something or someone or other. We were very important anyway. It was vital that we succeeded; everything hung in the balance. I had \"borrowed\" my mother’s carving knife and had it stuck into the waistband of my shorts – like a real explorer I told my friend. I used it to hack at the jungle undergrowth we were slowly making our way through – the native machete wielding bearers had disappeared because of the multitude of ferocious wild animals we were always encountering.\n\nThat expedition had been very unlucky – we’d lost a couple of the natives right at the start to a huge pack of lions and tigers (Like I said, I was nine – and very shaky on geography) and then the marauding bands of wild tribesmen had polished off a good number more – but we had fought valiantly and hard – heroes both. And we’d saved the rest of the bearers from hideous certain death (having their heads shrunk on their necks, and then being boiled alive for the tribesmen’s lunch. I didn’t have much sense of a time line too at that age).\n\nAs the sun lowered in the sky, and the evening crept up on us, I wiped my eyes clear of sweat and turned to my trusty companion:\n\n“How about we come back and finish this after tea? My Mum’s called us twice, and I know she’s got some ice-lollies in the freezer-box for afters”\n\n“What flavour?” asked my gallant sidekick.\n\n“Raspberry Ripples”\n\n“’k then – race ya?”\n\n<em><a href=\"http://www.writewords.org.uk/Hickman-Gibb/\">Avis Hickman-Gibb</a> is a newly established writer, living in rural Suffolk, England with her husband, one son and two cats.

(624, 1, '2016-10-03 10:16:22', '2016-10-03 18:16:22', 'It’s dusk. Outside, I can see the sky burning a deep red above the wasteland. The slit they call a window is a good six feet above the cool stone beneath my feet. I’d be able to look straight out of it if I weren’t restricted by the chains. I’m sitting four feet away by an old steel bed, just thinking, watching the day’s light ebbing away. I wonder for a moment if I’ve made a mistake, that maybe it’s going to take longer than I have. The walls are three feet deep, judging by the window ledge. The door is solid iron, bolted from the outside, and there are long rusty chains binding both my legs to a bracket in the wall. Escaping seems nearly impossible. Nearly.\n\nSome people believe that anything is possible, given the right incentive. Let’s say a man is locked in a cage. He’s warm, he has water, maybe some food. That man’s in no hurry to leave. He figures he has some time to think about his next move. Now stop feeding that man. He gets a little worried, tries to think of a plan. He knows he needs to get out in the next few days, before his strength wanes. Then you take away his fluids. Now he knows he has to get out or he’ll die soon. He starts thinking of ‘when’ rather than ‘how’.\n\nNow, tell the man in the cage, who’s tired, starving and thirsty, that you are going to take the life of his wife and child.\n\nEven an ordinary man would start clawing and tearing at the walls with his bare hands. An ordinary man would possess the rage and power of ten men, and he would scream and kick and tear at those walls. An ordinary man would fight against those walls until he drew his last breath.\n\nAn ordinary man.\n\nI have seen every type of prison ever designed. Pits, dungeons, water traps, cages. I’ve seen hundreds of them. From the inside. Now a man has put me in one so he can have my family. I know they won’t let him. I know they’ll fight him, and I know he’ll kill them.\n\nSo I know I will get out. There is not even the slightest doubt in my mind. The question is how. \n\nI draw one final, calming breath, and begin. It’s nearly black in here now. A rat brushes over my toes and I smile in the blackness. If a rat can come in, I can get out. I pull the chains as far as they’ll go from the wall. They don’t budge, but that doesn’t surprise me. A man has more strength available to him than the strength of his arms. If I could use my legs against the chains I could loosen them up a little. If I could also put my whole body weight against them I’d be in business.\n\nI carefully wrap one of the long chains around the strongest steel bedpost. It’s not as strong as I’d like, but it’ll hold. Now the chain holding my right arm to the wall is no longer doing its job. It’s linking the wall to the bedpost and the bedpost to my arm. The bed is braced to the cold floor slabs and creaks only slightly as I climb onto it. Maybe it’s sturdier than I thought. \n\nI leap as high as the chains will allow and bring all 220lbs of my bodyweight smashing down onto the chain. My body is jarred with the collision, and a flash of pain shoots through my foot, along my spine and spears into the base of my skull. I lose my footing in the very same instant and crash awkwardly onto my back . For a moment all I see are bright purple lights, and I have to bite my bottom lip hard to make sure the world doesn’t swim away. The taste of blood feels good in my mouth, and I get back onto the bed. \n\nThe chain is still very much attached to the wall, but there’s now a sliver of black between steel and stone. I leap even higher, and as I fall I kick downward with both feet, like a kid stomping in a puddle. Again, the shooting pain from the base of my feet. The chain gives a little this time, and I manage to steady myself against the wall. I just stand there, breathing in and out, swaying on the creaking chain. A bead of sweat rolls down the side of my face, and I notice a single, solitary star, winking at me through the window grate. Time’s moving on Jack, back to work.\n\nThe wall bracket has been hauled out maybe an inch now. I calculate three foot of wall, standard bolt of around a foot and a half. Seventeen inches to go. I wrap the chain around my right arm and use my left to grab the bracket. I take a deep breath, and lunge backward with all my might. Nothing. Not a creak. \n\nScrew you. \n\nI unwrap the chain from the bedpost. I run perpendicular to the bracket, hauling the chains behind me, like an ox ploughing the field. I nearly break my wrist when the chains reach the end of their slack, but I don’t feel any give in the chain. So I go the opposite way, running with the chain, and jolting the bracket to the right. Like working something side to side, but very slowly, with more purpose, more power. I go back to the bracket and try and jiggle it again. I’m about ready to try the bedpost again, when a tiny wedge of the stone wall closest the bracket chips off under the pressure. \n\nIt wakes me from my trance, and I notice that my knuckles are bleeding from contact with the wall. Outside, the star has moved a quarter width of the window, and winks flirtatiously.\n\nI turn my attention back to the wall bracket. I wrap the chain around my arm twice, and pull with all my strength. At first there is nothing, but then steadily, like pulling something heavy from thick, deep mud, I feel the bracket grate against the wall, and it squeals out perhaps two further inches. This boosts my adrenaline levels and I place my foot against the wall, and I pull against that chain with everything I have. Sweat floods down my face, and my whole body burns with effort. The bracket holds for a few seconds then finally and reluctantly screeches out, and I crash onto my back on the hard floor. I lift my arms in front of my face as the heavy rod, bracket and length of chain fall on me.\n\nI am now a free man in a small room.\n\nFor maybe four or five minutes, I lie on my back, the rod in my hands, just thinking, planning. There were two reasons for pulling the rod out of the wall rather than breaking the chains at the wrist. Number one was the timescale. It would take nearly double the time to release both wrists. Sure, I’m now trailing around ten feet of chain, but I’m mobile. Second reason was for this rod I have in my hands. Nothing in the whole cell is as strong as this eighteen inch piece of fat steel. Not the bedposts, not the chains, not the bars on the window, not the bolt on the door. \n\nNot even the door itself is as thick as this rod I now have in my hand, working with me instead of against me.

(626, 1, '2016-10-03 10:21:26', '2016-10-03 18:21:26', 'It’s dusk. Outside, I can see the sky burning a deep red above the wasteland. The slit they call a window is a good six feet above the cool stone beneath my feet. I’d be able to look straight out of it if I weren’t restricted by the chains. I’m sitting four feet away by an old steel bed, just thinking, watching the day’s light ebbing away. I wonder for a moment if I’ve made a mistake, that maybe it’s going to take longer than I have. The walls are three feet deep, judging by the window ledge. The door is solid iron, bolted from the outside, and there are long rusty chains binding both my legs to a bracket in the wall. Escaping seems nearly impossible. Nearly.\\r\\nSome people believe that anything is possible, given the right incentive. Let’s say a man is locked in a cage. He’s warm, he has water, maybe some food. That man’s in no hurry to leave. He figures he has some time to think about his next move. Now stop feeding that man. He gets a little worried, tries to think of a plan. He knows he needs to get out in the next few days, before his strength wanes. Then you take away his fluids. Now he knows he has to get out or he’ll die soon. He starts thinking of ‘when’ rather than ‘how’.\\r\\nNow, tell the man in the cage, who’s tired, starving and thirsty, that you are going to take the life of his wife and child.\\r\\nEven an ordinary man would start clawing and tearing at the walls with his bare hands. An ordinary man would possess the rage and power of ten men, and he would scream and kick and tear at those walls. An ordinary man would fight against those walls until he drew his last breath.\\r\\nAn ordinary man.\\r\\nI have seen every type of prison ever designed. Pits, dungeons, water traps, cages. I’ve seen hundreds of them. From the inside. Now a man has put me in one so he can have my family. I know they won’t let him. I know they’ll fight him, and I know he’ll kill them.\\r\\nSo I know I will get out. There is not even the slightest doubt in my mind. The question is how. \\r\\nI draw one final, calming breath, and begin. It’s nearly black in here now. A rat brushes over my toes and I smile in the blackness. If a rat can come in, I can get out. I pull the chains as far as they’ll go from the wall. They don’t budge, but that doesn’t surprise me. A man has more strength available to him than the strength of his arms. If I could use my legs against the chains I could loosen them up a little. If I could also put my whole body weight against them I’d be in business.\\r\\nI carefully wrap one of the long chains around the strongest steel bedpost. It’s not as strong as I’d like, but it’ll hold. Now the chain holding my right arm to the wall is no longer doing its job. It’s linking the wall to the bedpost and the bedpost to my arm. The bed is braced to the cold floor slabs and creaks only slightly as I climb onto it. Maybe it’s sturdier than I thought. \\r\\nI leap as high as the chains will allow and bring all 220lbs of my bodyweight smashing down onto the chain. My body is jarred with the collision, and a flash of pain shoots through my foot, along my spine and spears into the base of my skull. I lose my footing in the very same instant and crash awkwardly onto my back . For a moment all I see are bright purple lights, and I have to bite my bottom lip hard to make sure the world doesn’t swim away. The taste of blood feels good in my mouth, and I get back onto the bed. \\r\\nThe chain is still very much attached to the wall, but there’s now a sliver of black between steel and stone. I leap even higher, and as I fall I kick downward with both feet, like a kid stomping in a puddle. Again, the shooting pain from the base of my feet. The chain gives a little this time, and I manage to steady myself against the wall. I just stand there, breathing in and out, swaying on the creaking chain. A bead of sweat rolls down the side of my face, and I notice a single, solitary star, winking at me through the window grate. Time’s moving on Jack, back to work.\\r\\nThe wall bracket has been hauled out maybe an inch now. I calculate three foot of wall, standard bolt of around a foot and a half. Seventeen inches to go. I wrap the chain around my right arm and use my left to grab the bracket. I take a deep breath, and lunge backward with all my might. Nothing. Not a creak. \\r\\nScrew you. \\r\\nI unwrap the chain from the bedpost. I run perpendicular to the bracket, hauling the chains behind me, like an ox ploughing the field. I nearly break my wrist when the chains reach the end of their slack, but I don’t feel any give in the chain. So I go the opposite way, running with the chain, and jolting the bracket to the right. Like working something side to side, but very slowly, with more purpose, more power. I go back to the bracket and try and jiggle it again. I’m about ready to try the bedpost again, when a tiny wedge of the stone wall closest the bracket chips off under the pressure. \\r\\nIt wakes me from my trance, and I notice that my knuckles are bleeding from contact with the wall. Outside, the star has moved a quarter width of the window, and winks flirtatiously.\\r\\nI turn my attention back to the wall bracket. I wrap the chain around my arm twice, and pull with all my strength. At first there is nothing, but then steadily, like pulling something heavy from thick, deep mud, I feel the bracket grate against the wall, and it squeals out perhaps two further inches. This boosts my adrenaline levels and I place my foot against the wall, and I pull against that chain with everything I have. Sweat floods down my face, and my whole body burns with effort. The bracket holds for a few seconds then finally and reluctantly screeches out, and I crash onto my back on the hard floor. I lift my arms in front of my face as the heavy rod, bracket and length of chain fall on me.\\r\\nI am now a free man in a small room.\\r\\nFor maybe four or five minutes, I lie on my back, the rod in my hands, just thinking, planning. There were two reasons for pulling the rod out of the wall rather than breaking the chains at the wrist. Number one was the timescale. It would take nearly double the time to release both wrists. Sure, I’m now trailing around ten feet of chain, but I’m mobile. Second reason was for this rod I have in my hands. Nothing in the whole cell is as strong as this eighteen inch piece of fat steel. Not the bedposts, not the chains, not the bars on the window, not the bolt on the door. \\r\\nNot even the door itself is as thick as this rod I now have in my hand, working with me instead of against me. I pull myself up onto my haunches, and glance one last time out the window. My lucky star has gone, but in its place are a dozen more, twinkling and smiling at me. I smile right back at them as I tighten my grip on that rod and I turn my back on those stars. My family needs me, and I have work to do.\\r\\nEscaping had seemed nearly impossible.

She didn’t come over anymore, early in the morning, her hair pulled back tightly in a ponytail on the back of her head, ready to play whatever silly games you and the rest of gang concocted.  No, she didn’t even cross Kimball Street anymore, going through her backyard and out onto Haden Avenue when leaving the neighborhood. You would wave to her, sometimes, when she would be getting the mail or helping her mom in the garden, and she wouldn’t wave back. Her face would drop to the ground pretending not to see you, or she would hide behind her mom or even run back inside the house. She ignored you now, and when you stop and think about it, about two of you and how you used to be, it really upset you.\n\nShe didn’t come over and play basketball anymore, leaving the teams horribly uneven and the game not as much fun to play. Sure, she wasn’t very good, always tripping over her stray shoelaces or kicking the ball instead of dribbling it, but at least she was there. You might go over and help her up when she would fall, sometimes, depending on if the other boys were watching, but you would always make fun of her, calling her names like CLUTZ!  and LEFT FOOTED FREAK! The two other boys who played with you would laugh and giggle at her, joining in on the fun. You always thought that she would be back, but now she plays tennis with two very different boys. They have leg hair and mustaches, and drive around the neighborhood with their music playing way too loud. She goes out with them late at night, sitting on the lap of one of them as the other drives the sleek, black, coupe car down Kimball Street.\n\nShe didn’t come hunt for buried treasure anymore, making the task of finding the riches much more cumbersome. She used to help you draw up the map and key, marking out the latitudes and longitudes and symbols because you had a hard time reading and writing. None of the tutors that were hired could do anything for you, and that upset you too: the fact that you were kind of hopeless in that sense. She was the only one of the three who knew about it, and she never made fun of you for it, having you tell the others that it was the woman’s job to make the map. She would steal her dad’s big, denim overalls from his closet, the pockets large enough to hold all the equipment needed for the dig: the map, a mini-shovel, a small flashlight, and diary to document what you found. You would all give each other really snazzy sounding explorer names, like Bobby Trouble or Darren Danger. She was Kathryn Caper, the crappiest of all the names, yes, and you felt the need to tell her that in front of the gang over and over. Now she lays outside in her front yard wearing an orange bikini. She sits on a big yellow beach towel, looking at preteen magazines about boys and makeup while talking on her parent’s cordless phone.  You watch her as the three of you set up to dig for more treasure, her tiny, tanning hands rubbing lotion into her legs, and you think about how she used to help you dig. Tiny smudges of dirt would smear on her cheeks as she would giggle and throw clumps of soil and grass at you. You try not to cry as the other two boys break ground.\n\nShe wasn’t around when it came time to play cowboys and Indians, making it impossible to play that game. You can’t have one of the other boys be the damsel in distress that the Indians kidnap; that would be gross. Instead you have to play cops and robbers. It’s quite unfair, the two other boys being the thieves and you playing the cop, making it almost impossible for you to stop crime. You chase the robbers around the backyard, following far behind because one of them distracted you while the other grabbed the cash. They spilt up, one of them ducking down the side yard and the other springing down the street. It would be so much easier if she had just come back over. She could take the one boy who ran down the side of the house, while you chased after the other boy running down the street. Between the two of you, the crime could be foiled, but they always got away, taunting you as they ran. You get mad at her as you cross your front yard and see her lying out on the yellow towel. You yell STUP"ID"! and LAME! as you circle around hoping she hears you.\n\nShe didn’t come play Ghost In The Graveyard anymore, which really made you mad because you were still scared of the dark. You would have to take a small flashlight with you, using it carefully so as not to let the two other boys see you, for they would call you a WHIMP! or a WUSS! That would really hurt.  The game would go on forever. She was a great seeker, and without her it was hard for you to find the boys on your own. While you were tiptoeing through the dark, she would be having a loud party across the street with those damn tennis boys. You would watch their shadows as they swayed back and forth with the music, all of the bodies in the room meshing into one. There would be this pain in your gut, this twisting, binding, sensation that made you have to call the rest of the game off so you could go in your room and lay down. From there, you would watch until the tennis boys leave, which was always way after 10:30—much longer than she ever stayed out with you.\n\nThen there was that one time when she kissed you. She really didn’t do that anymore, that’s for sure. The four of you were playing house, not one of your shining moments. You all played in her basement because that’s where her Playskool kitchen set was, and because no one could see you down there. The two other boys were the children and you and her played the husband and wife. She was almost done cleaning up after dinner while you finished putting the kids to bed, when she stepped right in your way and kissed you. It was real gentle, on the mouth, smooth and lukewarm. And at first you hated it. She looked right at you as she pulled away, both of you surprised that it actually happened, her eyes like coins in a wishing well. First, you spat, saying things like EWWW! and GROSS! It was then you noticed that her hair wasn’t pulled back. It was down, flowing onto her shoulders looking like a stream of blonde chocolate. It smelled good too, like flowers and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. You spat some more, rubbing your hands on your tongue trying to get the girl cooties off. And then she started crying. She ran upstairs, the back of her polka dot dress—the one dress she had that she tried to keep nice—kicking up as she tore off toward her room. You felt awful, not because of what you said, but because at that moment you didn’t like the kiss. You wanted to though, maybe.\n\nShe never did that again, no sir.\n\nShe was sitting outside, her skin a nice basted brown color, the white of the lotion being sucked into the meat on the backs of her legs. You were standing outside by your basketball hoop, shooting some baskets by yourself. The other two boys had stopped coming around soon after she did. You tried calling them, a lot, but they were too busy with after school football games and reading car magazines behind the gymnasium, and all they talked about was trying to get laid. You watched as her tiny fingers turned page after page in some teen bopper magazine, while you have to ran to catch the ball every time you missed, trying to prevent it from rolling under two big pines trees next to the hoop. It was then when you decided you had enough. You picked up the ball and crossed Kimball Street, that tightening feeling returning to your gut. You stand over her, the small straps of her bikini lying carelessly on her golden brown back.\n\n“Wanna play some basketball?” you asked, holding the weathered old ball out for her to see.\n\n“I’m just too old for that now,” she said, her body not flinching in the slightest.\n\nYou walked back across the street alone, heaved up a jump shot that rimmed in and out, and decided to try and hunt for buried treasure by yourself. \n\n<em>Nick Ostdick is a fiction writer from the Chicago area.

I could have been more gracious when he asked for peroxide and a band-aid.  Instead, I cut my eyes, glaring at him before going into the bathroom to get the supplies.\n\n“Can you do it for me?” he asks, and steps forward, holds the door open with his good arm.  “I’m not crazy or nothing.  I swear it.”\n\n“Come on,” I sigh, wave him through the front door and to the bathroom, to the sink.  “Put it here.”\n\n I’m just too clumsy,” he apologizes and scratches his forehead at the same time that lukewarm water (I assume because I don’t reach my fingers in to feel) hits his bloody arm, running off in a pink stream down the drain.  It’s an icky sideways cut with puss around the edges almost the same color as the bubbling peroxide, and coarse black hairs on the unaffected skin surround the wound like soldiers, except now his arm is wet.  So the hairs look more like sleeping soldiers.\n\nEither because I stare too much or he feels ashamed, he says “I hit it against the wall.”  The bruise looks at least a couple days old, sticky and red, now oozing puss and peroxide.  I turn the water off and cover the bruise in gauze and an ace bandage, but he doesn’t turn to leave.\n\nHe wants more?  A band-aid?  More peroxide? …Neosporin?

Go.\n\nWhat else does he want, what in the living room has caught his attention, and if I give it to him, will he finally leave, or see it as an invitation to stay longer or an extension of friendship and come back.  But he doesn’t want anything in the living room I discover when he turns to me and says real gentle-like, “Black fella live here just before you,” because he wants to prolong his stay, and he lets go of his arm and turns his head upward, so I can only see the whites of his eyes because he’s so much taller than me.  Then he looks back down so that now I can see the blue irises and his eyes are wet, like he’s about to cry. I take my hand off the door knob.\n\n‘Yep,” he continues and draws out the word, preparing to say more, which he does.  “Nicest man you ever want to meet.  We was good friends.  Lost touch, though.  Last time I seen him was at the Food Lion two, three years ago.”\n\n “Quite compelling, but –“\n\n “Think you can give me one more round of that Peroxide?”  He wipes his eyes and takes a step toward the bathroom.\n\n At that moment is when I feel most the effect of the nap.  All the bad stuff  – disoriented, slightly heavy, impatient, groggy, mean and sick – tears straight through my chest and down my arms into a hand that yanks the front door open so fast it bends the slinky doorstopper and rams into the wall with a force that makes my neighbor stop and stare, all wet-eyed and trembling.\n\nI let it all out in a steady stream of harsh air.  I wish he would go.  I’m not myself and I slept too long today and now I’m leaning against the door as if I’m too heavy for my legs.  I put my hands on my knees and bend over and mumble between deep breaths “Just go.  Just go. Just go.”  He does but first puts his hand on the small of my back, leaning over my hunched body to whisper his apologies.  I close the door and lie down on the couch, but my body won’t relax.  My ears pulse in the same angry beat as my heart, and my back burns.\n\nI should go and apologize.  I know this, except the part of me that feels heavy won’t let me up off the couch and the mean part doesn’t care.  Today, I napped too long.

Spoken in a whisper, it sounded like Alpha, a promising beginning. But perhaps creation, once it has been opened with Alpha, can only be followed by silence.\n\nSitting in her chair on the porch she watched the empty parked cars. Frost scribbled on the windows and a small after-image froze: her fingers dangled in the air after she crossed herself three times. She often said to herself: I am the only one here.\n\nMuch earlier in her life (she had come over mountains and the ocean), she had seen rivers that looked like small streams, cities at night that flashed and were gone. Then she fell from above, and crashed, and ever since then she was in a flat country she never understood.\n\nShe would think to herself: It’s only when I’m sleeping that I never say “I’m dreaming.”\n\nThere were places out of time that all flowed into different corners of the halls. For instance, her husband Charles reading the Iliad in the yellow chair by the plastic potted ferns. Or a rubbed-out message in chalk that was blowing over the tire prints in the oval gravel drive.\n\nBut when she dreamed, she was always the same age she is now.\n\nWhen a hand appeared, a face, or a voice was heard from staff or visitors, everything changed: the black dog’s paws clicked across the porch, then came the tail eagerly slapping the floor: ear-dreams.\n\nOrpha on the porch, waving her arms, as if she were imitating the movements of the leaves,  or  saying goodbye to someone, or hailing one of the parked cars. She had angry, comprehending eyes. Palms up, she felt strong, and with her eyes closed she could believe the sunlight that settled upon her was warm fur. Those moments reminded her of nothing but: I AM.\n\nOnce, it streamed everywhere, and she was present, joined to one place. Those friendly and curious hands cupped the immense realm beyond the mountains: the edge of a continent. Death for once was all on the surface – the waves took it away. And she existed as skin, hunger, love: I AM, I AM. She smiled, but the eyes in her dream still looked angry. “Why am I here?” she asked herself. “Why am I here?” When she awoke, she was making motions with her fingers as if she were threading a needle.\n\n“Those jerks and jabs with her fingers mimic the speech of someone who stutters,” said the doctor examining her. “Was she a stutterer?”\n\n“The black dog knows,” she heard.\n\nNurse Jane was panting over her, her face contracted in one firm, set expression. She wanted to shout: “I know words. But do you? No, but you say you do. And that, dear Nurse Jane, that is the broken promise of speech: you think you are using words, but the words are using you.”\n\nThey carried her to a freshly made bed. It was a new room. Doctor’s orders. She heard him say the word change and out of his mouth chattered something like tumbling coins. (To whom had thoughts ever been so palpable?).\n\n“Put me out in the forest,” she wanted to say. “Lay me down among the sticks and the rotting leaves.“\n\nThe doctor: “Did she say something?”\n\nNurse Jane: “Orpha, did you say something?”\n\nI’m the log in the forest that will become the Savior. I’m the sculptor carving the log in the forest that will become the Savior. I’m the carpenter nailing the Savior to the post.\n\nThe wind made a sound like an animal squishing through wet leaves. Then the animal was gone, too.\n\nBut by and by the sliver of light under the door became a thin white bone. A drawer being opened was a short bark. The came the click of nails on the floor and the eager panting, panting, which in the ear-dream again became the ticking of the clock.\n\nTicking, ticking.\n\nAnguish.\n\nAnguish, passing from dark to dark and eyes lying in wait for the light.\n\nHer neighbor in the next bed was again busy counting, one thousand three, one thousand four, but this time Orpha’s pulse didn’t race to catch up. A single sound was repeated over and over – not a word, not yet a word, but something like “hmm?” blown through cupped hands.\n\nNurse Jane turning to her surprised, said: “If you don’t acknowledge this small miracle now, Orpha, you’ll be mute forever.”\n\n“Yes, yes, “ Orpha nodded, chomping on her teeth, as though the words, her first spoken words in ten years, didn’t really fit her right.\n\n“I want to say something that can be heard long after I’ve finished speaking,” said Orpha.\n\nNurse June clapped her hands. “Say it! What will it be?”\n\n “Listen,” said Orpha, nearly shouting. “If the Lord really has words for it, this is it.”\n\n “Yes? Yes? Tell me. “ Nurse Jane bent over her.

There were a lot of sidelong looks, lowered voices, and a general air of disapproval whenever her name was mentioned.\n \nWe all loved her.  She was so different from all the other grown-ups, with her wild grey hair caught up in a comb that never quite managed to capture those wayward curls.

I was always sticky and grubby – I spent most of my time outdoors playing with my new friend. We went to the park, played in my back garden, and roamed the local vacant land – a very mysterious and lonely place when you’re nine years old. \\r\\nThe little plot was quiet and still – like a forgotten, empty writing book left over from school. It was close to home – I could see the roof of my house – and yet it was so different. There was a wild tangle all over it’s surface – a strange mix of fast growing weeds and the more familiar garden plants my mother grew at home. It felt like another country – but just around the corner from home; very handy when you wanted to play pretend.\\r\\nThat day we were intrepid explorers, bent on a secret mission to save – something or someone or other. We were very important anyway. It was vital that we succeeded; everything hung in the balance. I had \"borrowed\" my mother’s carving knife and had it stuck into the waistband of my shorts – like a real explorer I told my friend. I used it to hack at the jungle undergrowth we were slowly making our way through – the native machete wielding bearers had disappeared because of the multitude of ferocious wild animals we were always encountering.\\r\\nThat expedition had been very unlucky – we’d lost a couple of the natives right at the start to a huge pack of lions and tigers (Like I said, I was nine – and very shaky on geography) and then the marauding bands of wild tribesmen had polished off a good number more – but we had fought valiantly and hard – heroes both. And we’d saved the rest of the bearers from hideous certain death (having their heads shrunk on their necks, and then being boiled alive for the tribesmen’s lunch. I didn’t have much sense of a time line too at that age).\\r\\nAs the sun lowered in the sky, and the evening crept up on us, I wiped my eyes clear of sweat and turned to my trusty companion:\\r\\n“How about we come back and finish this after tea? My Mum’s called us twice, and I know she’s got some ice-lollies in the freezer-box for afters”\\r\\n“What flavour?” asked my gallant sidekick.\\r\\n“Raspberry Ripples”\\r\\n“’k then – race ya?”\\r\\n<em><a href=\"http://www.writewords.org.uk/Hickman-Gibb/\">Avis Hickman-Gibb</a> is a newly established writer, living in rural Suffolk, England with her husband, one son and two cats.

Despite having done it once a fortnight for almost a year. Jokes wear thin but this one had eroded. Well for me it had, however not for the newer hordes of strugglers who sniggered at this wit, those who''d heard of the musician at least. Blue shiny tracksuit pants and a zipped top in the middle of summer. Scuffed black dress shoes inappropriately completed the ensemble. Craggy features, stained teeth and sunken jowls from a lifetime of cheap cider and tobacco aged him beyond his years. Perched on the edge of the waiting area couch in the Job centre, his perch, which he''d occupied since the closing of the mines in the eighties. Hair greased, clean shaven, but too high above the ear almost reaching the temple. But I was the figure of amusement. Nice. Let it wash over, don''t even acknowledge his outburst.

I found them in the bath tub, legs given way under the weight of their bodies. I moved to turn the tap on, rid myself of this nightmare, but as my hand touched the metal a spasm of pain shot through my arm. They seemed to disintegrate in front of me, a child’s scribble done in reverse as layer after layer of the messy black lines were removed.\\r\\nMy eyes flickered open to the alarm clock shining 04:48 in angular red numerals.

It was stripped, bare, the mattress stained in one corner. I remembered how, as the illness had taken hold, he would wake up terrified of the spiders that, he said, streamed into the house through every gap; under the doors, through the vent in the bathroom. I would check, gently sooth him. Sometimes there was one there, a single creature looking – at least I imagined – rather bewildered by all the commotion. Robbie would scream and cry as I would coax it gently onto an electricity bill and shake it onto the path below.\\r\\nAs things got worse, he spent more and more nights at the hospital. Most times I stayed, getting what little sleep I could in a fold up bed beside him. Others – like tonight – I let his father stay with him while I headed home for the sleep I knew would never eventuate.\\r\\nI sat there in Robbie’s room for more than half an hour before the loud ringing of the phone destroyed the silence. My son died that autumn night, with the branches brushing against the windows and the creaking call of a tui sounding in the background.

See, she believed that the human touch could evaporate without reason and beyond the possibilities of eternity. But, when she told this to others, they refused to look at the marks on her breasts. But didn''t want you want to touch her? Didn''t you want to see inside her head and wonder how God made naked bodies that hide behind foggy windows? And believed that if she had pushed herself hard enough, she might have floated away to Neverland and never had to do anything imagined.\n\nII.\nHis eyes made her cry but they didn''t speak at all. See, she believed that if we could make words from not speaking anything at all and she cried while the world dropped tears from her eyes. If this had not happened, she might have had nothing to look at when staring outside. She might not have told their secrets, yes, theirs, without ever having made a telephone call. Just lied in bed and dared someone, anyone to knock on the door. That would have brought us to the center of the stage but the lights were off and she didn''t care to turn them back on. But not that it would have mattered, she wouldn''t have opened the door. She wouldn''t have moved past the cheap floral bedspread to the television. Nor would she have turned on the television to watch old wrestling shows from the ''can''t-kill-me-80''s-era.'' No, but she wouldn''t answer the door if anyone knocked. She''d rather run and hide from him. She''d rather make him believe that she had flown away. Those eyes that she imagined about when she sat and waited. She would rather do anything than watch those eyes over and over again. Didn''t you want to destroy her? Didn''t you want to not say a word and wonder how the hell God made bodies that won''t float, eyes that won''t cry and knees that won''t plead? And you didn''t believe her when she said that she pushed herself to stay. She suffered. She fell. She bled. Everyone else had known but you. Everyone else had watched and waited.\n\nIII.\nHis heart escaped from in between her legs but it was never his to give in the first place. See, she believed that if she waited, he would allow her to be a free woman but she was wrong. The window won''t open and she would have to hurt herself to fly away. She dreamed last night that you destroyed some other woman and that it was she standing outside, next to the telephone booth, with a pink scarf and blue lips, waiting. The ring flew out of the window. The knock on the door came again but nothing stopped her from putting those big hands around her throat as you dared her to look away from you. She stood there smoking a cigarette, laughing as her dreams crumbled before her eyes. She bleeds, she dies, she rumbles, she shakes and the world goes on. Didn''t you hear her? She called your name. But no, you want to watch her watching you and wonder how God made bodies but God didn''t make minds? And you didn''t believe her, so you pushed her down, again and again. You could never imagine the possibilities so she floated away with both of our hearts, yours and hers.\n\n\nIV.\nHis lies were the reason she waited. She tuned everything out. Even in blood, even in death, she kept her promise. She clutched it like a purse and kept it locked away. It was found again in this room, amidst the smell of dried sex, Chanel No. 5 and one lit table lamp. The room was empty. The serving tray in the hallway covered with half-eaten food and she waited. The telephone rang but she knew it was coming from across the street. The train not stopping, the best of the worst, the sound of a man''s voice. All she could hear was the faint sound of glass breaking. If he made a promise, he didn''t keep it that night. But she was ready; her lines rehearsed: Didn''t you want to lie? Truth be told, didn''t you want her to wonder how God made bodies? And he didn''t believe her. He pushed her away. She fought back but he broke her. He lied. He killed her. So, she destroyed the one thing he loved. With the curl of a hand, she welcomed his lies. Two become one and not three.\n \n\nV.\nHe sat by the window and she walked by. He winked at her but she was not sitting next to him. She watched the eyes, all four of them. Two pairs of eyes smirked. It was the not first time that had happened. She was used to being in third place. Ten days later, she saw him again. It was six blocks away. She had asked for the time; it was all she could think to say. Seven o''clock on the dot. They stood near a flea market where a Cambodian woman walked by and offered them eight-legged spiders, cooked to a crisp.\n\nAs the rain dropped, silence engulfed them until he told a joke that made her blush and five fingers went over her mouth.

See, she believed that the human touch could evaporate without reason and beyond the possibilities of eternity. But, when she told this to others, they refused to look at the marks on her breasts. But didn''t want you want to touch her? Didn''t you want to see inside her head and wonder how God made naked bodies that hide behind foggy windows? And believed that if she had pushed herself hard enough, she might have floated away to Neverland and never had to do anything imagined.\\r\\nII.\r\nHis eyes made her cry but they didn''t speak at all. See, she believed that if we could make words from not speaking anything at all and she cried while the world dropped tears from her eyes. If this had not happened, she might have had nothing to look at when staring outside. She might not have told their secrets, yes, theirs, without ever having made a telephone call. Just lied in bed and dared someone, anyone to knock on the door. That would have brought us to the center of the stage but the lights were off and she didn''t care to turn them back on. But not that it would have mattered, she wouldn''t have opened the door. She wouldn''t have moved past the cheap floral bedspread to the television. Nor would she have turned on the television to watch old wrestling shows from the ''can''t-kill-me-80''s-era.'' No, but she wouldn''t answer the door if anyone knocked. She''d rather run and hide from him. She''d rather make him believe that she had flown away. Those eyes that she imagined about when she sat and waited. She would rather do anything than watch those eyes over and over again. Didn''t you want to destroy her? Didn''t you want to not say a word and wonder how the hell God made bodies that won''t float, eyes that won''t cry and knees that won''t plead? And you didn''t believe her when she said that she pushed herself to stay. She suffered. She fell. She bled. Everyone else had known but you. Everyone else had watched and waited.\\r\\nIII.\r\nHis heart escaped from in between her legs but it was never his to give in the first place. See, she believed that if she waited, he would allow her to be a free woman but she was wrong. The window won''t open and she would have to hurt herself to fly away. She dreamed last night that you destroyed some other woman and that it was she standing outside, next to the telephone booth, with a pink scarf and blue lips, waiting. The ring flew out of the window. The knock on the door came again but nothing stopped her from putting those big hands around her throat as you dared her to look away from you. She stood there smoking a cigarette, laughing as her dreams crumbled before her eyes. She bleeds, she dies, she rumbles, she shakes and the world goes on. Didn''t you hear her? She called your name. But no, you want to watch her watching you and wonder how God made bodies but God didn''t make minds? And you didn''t believe her, so you pushed her down, again and again. You could never imagine the possibilities so she floated away with both of our hearts, yours and hers.\\r\\n\r\nIV.\r\nHis lies were the reason she waited. She tuned everything out. Even in blood, even in death, she kept her promise. She clutched it like a purse and kept it locked away. It was found again in this room, amidst the smell of dried sex, Chanel No. 5 and one lit table lamp. The room was empty. The serving tray in the hallway covered with half-eaten food and she waited. The telephone rang but she knew it was coming from across the street. The train not stopping, the best of the worst, the sound of a man''s voice. All she could hear was the faint sound of glass breaking. If he made a promise, he didn''t keep it that night. But she was ready; her lines rehearsed: Didn''t you want to lie? Truth be told, didn''t you want her to wonder how God made bodies? And he didn''t believe her. He pushed her away. She fought back but he broke her. He lied. He killed her. So, she destroyed the one thing he loved. With the curl of a hand, she welcomed his lies. Two become one and not three.\r\n \\r\\nV.\r\nHe sat by the window and she walked by. He winked at her but she was not sitting next to him. She watched the eyes, all four of them. Two pairs of eyes smirked. It was the not first time that had happened. She was used to being in third place. Ten days later, she saw him again. It was six blocks away. She had asked for the time; it was all she could think to say. Seven o''clock on the dot. They stood near a flea market where a Cambodian woman walked by and offered them eight-legged spiders, cooked to a crisp.\\r\\nAs the rain dropped, silence engulfed them until he told a joke that made her blush and five fingers went over her mouth. It took him all of twelve seconds to apologize. She smiled and he noticed a gap, separating eleven of her teeth on the left from eleven on the right. That happened right across the street. She didn''t remember, not until that night. \\r\\n\r\nBy then, she was crying. But no one could tell. The window covered her sorrow the rain covered her tears. He walked by again.

You love life and intend to affirm it by being a co-author in the shaping of a destiny you have faith in: it can only be for your good.\n\n At the age of twenty, clutching the hand of your seventy-two year old grandmother, you board a plane on the tarmac of a tiny island nation with $120 dollars in your pocket. When you land in the United States of America you decide this is truly the first day of your life because you have adopted a new country as the one that complements your values, dreams and big capacity for joy. \n\n The next day you resist invitations to explore the city of your new home—Atlanta—because you need to find a job. You put on your suit, take a train that turns out to be the wrong one and enter a city in which, during the next five hours, you will become lost countless number of times. You apply for over twenty jobs and finally take a break by sitting on the curb of a busy street to take off your shoes and massage your feet. \n\n You end up getting a job in a bank where you work for a year to finance your first year of college tuition. You read voraciously and use some of your college money to buy too many books. No Matter. You are reading about two per week. The perfectibility of your mind is a child’s fantasy carried over into early adult life that you cannot give up.\n\n Life is on your side.\n\n You enter college full-time and work in a bank for thirty-five to forty hours per week. You impose an exacting regimen on yourself, and people say you’re the most disciplined person they know. You write tons of newspaper editorials and make around $1,000 from your writing in one year. You maintain an A+ average, graduate magna cum laude and take off a year to write a novel. You’re ruthless with yourself when the rejections come in. For every rejection you receive, you send out thirty more submissions. You decide to get an agent. That proves just as difficult as finding a publisher. You snag one after 250 rejections.\n\n Graduate school is tough, but in your third week you’ve already decided on a dissertation topic. You identify the month and date of your graduation in five years time. \n\n It all comes through as you planned. You graduate four and a half years later with a Ph.D in philosophy. It hasn’t all been easy. You’ve sometimes been weighted down by mood swings. You’ve fallen in love, fallen out of love, and left your partner for another person. But your creativity has never left you. You write your dissertation in little over a year, and you get a good teaching position.\n\n Reality is there for you to shape it.\n\n You write and publish your first book with a good publisher in nineteen months. You read like a book addict. You are always writing.

During the next couple of years you carry a constant Death Baby inside of you, one that dreams of and yearns for death. It feels like you’re being eaten from the inside by this creature. But still, you write. Poetry comes flowing out of you like mineral water from hidden rocks. You’ll spend the next couple of years revising each poem for a minimum of two years. Death Baby grows and you feed him little pills that satisfy him for a while. For one year it feels like you are drowning, but the poems just come pouring out. In spite of it all, you teach, think and write and finish a new book.\n\n Suicide seems like a good thing to think about. Suicide is calming. You empty a bottle of pills in your hand one night and look at them for an hour. You contemplate them like little religious icons. Religious icons, though, belong on a shelf. You put them back in the bottle and line them up with your other bottled icons. They make a shrine you neurotically fetishize.\n\n Suicide seems like a real possibility. You begin to think about it constantly. The pain is unbearable. You think: how to do it? One day to ease the pain you take a lot of pills. At 2 a.m you still can’t sleep. You feed yourself more Xanax tablets. Beginning from the morning you end up having taken twelve tablets by 2:30 a.m. You slip in and out of consciousness and then something shifts. You enter the dark hour, a period where it feels like you’re slipping over to the other side. You don some clothes and somehow walk to the hospital. You are interred in the psychiatric ward for four days. Bedlam is not glamorous. You wonder which way is home.\n\n Life is still on your side.\n\n Bipolar is the most lethal of all mental illnesses. It accounts for more suicides than the other illnesses and can catapult a person into the stratospheres of euphoria and then down into the darkest doldrums of depression and despair. When in the hypomanic phase one can feel powerful, be extremely creative. You hear this as a diagnosis is rattled off to you. It makes sense, you think. And you begin to feel comforted. You are prescribed Seroquel and Abilify and you begin to move once again in the world. The poems keep coming, the sequel to your first book progresses and you feel elation.

Then it starts. The world becomes flat. You feel flat. You cannot feel. You are numb. Your confidence is now erased from your soul. You cannot write. Words just won’t come. Verbal creativity—once a constitutive feature of your identity—is gone. You stare at the screen; there are no words to fill even a quarter of it. In one year there have been no new poems, although, thank God, you got one published in a good literary journal. All inspiration has gone; the vision behind the work is a blur, like the streaked makeup of an aging harridan. You are a harridan. Making love becomes a chore. The libido is a strange capacity you used to have but can’t remember what it feels like. You cannot read. Dullness descends like some presage of gloom every time you attempt to tackle a book.

(666, 1, '2016-10-18 09:47:49', '2016-10-18 17:47:49', 'It is 1975. I’m sitting with my father in the sofa-like front seat of his father’s car which he’s borrowed to take me for a ride. Just the two of us.  It’s a red car of some make; a 1960-something Vauxhall. I’m ten years old. My father smells of coconut oil. He always smells good—fresh, earthy and natural. We’ve just come from a long drive where he told me to just be who I want to be. \n\n“You were cut out to be a writer and a poet. Don’t get sidetracked into thinking you have to be a lawyer or any of that nonsense,” he says.\n\nHe’s been on this mission to save my poetic soul. His mother has been paying for my private tutor in math and algebra, and he keeps telling me not to waste my time, that I’ll never need math “because the soul of a poet transcends the exactitude of mathematics. You’ll never be one of those persons trapped in arid mental categories.” \n\nIn the car we’re silent. We’re looking at the floor. He edges closer and puts his arm around me. The aroma of coconut oil—which he’d always used to tan his really pasty skin, so now it’s a rich bronze and glows a little as I look up, sadly, into his green eyes—mingles with his sweat. I can see my granddad, my mother’s father seething on the front porch. Everyone’s thought of my dad as a real loser, a bum who can’t hold a job. He can give his children a lot of hugs and kisses, and he sings really well to them, but boy, he sure can’t support them financially. That job’s been left to my mother. Yesterday he spontaneously dropped by and said: “J, ask for anything you want. Anything in the whole wide world.”\n\n“I want a lemon meringue pie.” \n\nTen minutes later he comes by with the biggest pie I’d ever seen. I eat it right there on the spot.\n\nWe’re still looking on the floor of the car and I know that he’s going to say something that will make us very sad. He’s just emancipated me from a lifetime of school drudgery (I don’t ever have to do math, I can skip classes and read novels and poetry), and now he’s going to spoil it with bad news. I can sense it. The silence is unbearable. He begins to weep. Silently. He moves in closer. His body is trembling a little bit. I see his right ankle twitching in his Jesus sandal. Beads of sweat are breaking out on his legs, and he’s toying with the pleats in his denim shorts. \n\nHe says: “I love you, Jason. I love you so much. I love you more than anything and anyone else.” \n\nI feel numb and sad at the same time. I feel lonely and confused. I want to hug him back, but I just sit there looking at my skinny, brown legs. I dare to look up at his face and see something I can’t write about because I can’t understand it.  I see a look of absolute despair. He rests his head against mine and whispers over and over again: “I love you, I love you. I love you.”\n\nI look up, wondering where my brother is. My grandfather is walking towards the car. He shouts something inaudible. He wants me back in the house, and suddenly my father bolts from the car and says, still crying: “I need to speak to my son. I have a right to speak to my son.” \n\nI’d never seen my father in this state before. I can’t recall the exchange. I only remember the anger of my grandfather and the sobbing desperation in my father’s voice as he defends his right to speak to his son. I eventually leave the car and my father makes one last attempt to hold me as my grandfather asserts his right over me.     \n\nWe return to the car and sit, huddled, holding hands, weeping. Sinning right there in the open. Just the two of us\n\nAnd I loved him.  And he loved me back.\n\nThe day before I had wrapped my legs around his waist and kissed him all over his neck and he told his mother: “I think my son is in love with me.”  \n\nHe had lost his battles, tried to take his own life twice. The world told him he was a fool and yet, he had told me that I was to be a writer, and that I was special. \n\n He said he’d seen God’s face and was seduced by its beauty. The world said he had caught schizophrenia.\n\nNow it was over. This love affair with my father. Just like that. He comes to the house a few months later dressed in a white robe, painted white boots, and a white sword tucked into a sash on his white belt. He wears a white turban over his head that stretches his green eyes into two eerie slits. \n\nHe will have to repudiate us, he says. He has been called out to do God’s work, to be his servant and to be the bride of Christ. He explains and explains.

(667, 1, '2016-10-18 09:49:24', '2016-10-18 17:49:24', 'It is 1975. I’m sitting with my father in the sofa-like front seat of his father’s car which he’s borrowed to take me for a ride. Just the two of us.  It’s a red car of some make; a 1960-something Vauxhall. I’m ten years old. My father smells of coconut oil. He always smells good—fresh, earthy and natural. We’ve just come from a long drive where he told me to just be who I want to be. \\r\\n“You were cut out to be a writer and a poet. Don’t get sidetracked into thinking you have to be a lawyer or any of that nonsense,” he says.\\r\\nHe’s been on this mission to save my poetic soul. His mother has been paying for my private tutor in math and algebra, and he keeps telling me not to waste my time, that I’ll never need math “because the soul of a poet transcends the exactitude of mathematics. You’ll never be one of those persons trapped in arid mental categories.” \\r\\nIn the car we’re silent. We’re looking at the floor. He edges closer and puts his arm around me. The aroma of coconut oil—which he’d always used to tan his really pasty skin, so now it’s a rich bronze and glows a little as I look up, sadly, into his green eyes—mingles with his sweat. I can see my granddad, my mother’s father seething on the front porch. Everyone’s thought of my dad as a real loser, a bum who can’t hold a job. He can give his children a lot of hugs and kisses, and he sings really well to them, but boy, he sure can’t support them financially. That job’s been left to my mother. Yesterday he spontaneously dropped by and said: “J, ask for anything you want. Anything in the whole wide world.”\\r\\n“I want a lemon meringue pie.” \\r\\nTen minutes later he comes by with the biggest pie I’d ever seen. I eat it right there on the spot.\\r\\nWe’re still looking on the floor of the car and I know that he’s going to say something that will make us very sad. He’s just emancipated me from a lifetime of school drudgery (I don’t ever have to do math, I can skip classes and read novels and poetry), and now he’s going to spoil it with bad news. I can sense it. The silence is unbearable. He begins to weep. Silently. He moves in closer. His body is trembling a little bit. I see his right ankle twitching in his Jesus sandal. Beads of sweat are breaking out on his legs, and he’s toying with the pleats in his denim shorts. \\r\\nHe says: “I love you, Jason. I love you so much. I love you more than anything and anyone else.” \\r\\nI feel numb and sad at the same time. I feel lonely and confused. I want to hug him back, but I just sit there looking at my skinny, brown legs. I dare to look up at his face and see something I can’t write about because I can’t understand it.  I see a look of absolute despair. He rests his head against mine and whispers over and over again: “I love you, I love you. I love you.”\\r\\nI look up, wondering where my brother is. My grandfather is walking towards the car. He shouts something inaudible. He wants me back in the house, and suddenly my father bolts from the car and says, still crying: “I need to speak to my son. I have a right to speak to my son.” \\r\\nI’d never seen my father in this state before. I can’t recall the exchange. I only remember the anger of my grandfather and the sobbing desperation in my father’s voice as he defends his right to speak to his son. I eventually leave the car and my father makes one last attempt to hold me as my grandfather asserts his right over me.     \\r\\nWe return to the car and sit, huddled, holding hands, weeping. Sinning right there in the open. Just the two of us\\r\\nAnd I loved him.  And he loved me back.\\r\\nThe day before I had wrapped my legs around his waist and kissed him all over his neck and he told his mother: “I think my son is in love with me.”  \\r\\nHe had lost his battles, tried to take his own life twice. The world told him he was a fool and yet, he had told me that I was to be a writer, and that I was special. \\r\\n He said he’d seen God’s face and was seduced by its beauty. The world said he had caught schizophrenia.\\r\\nNow it was over. This love affair with my father. Just like that. He comes to the house a few months later dressed in a white robe, painted white boots, and a white sword tucked into a sash on his white belt. He wears a white turban over his head that stretches his green eyes into two eerie slits. \\r\\nHe will have to repudiate us, he says. He has been called out to do God’s work, to be his servant and to be the bride of Christ. He explains and explains. Then, what he calls the apocalyptic announcement: “Observe my son, I am now married now to Christ whom I love more than anything else, even you.”\\r\\nHe leaves, and he never looks back as I stand staring out into the distance, perhaps in the same spot where he’d stood a few months earlier asserting his right to speak to and weep with me. \\r\\nI get this in the mail from him a few weeks later.   \\r\\n<em>My Son, Oh my Son.\r\nHow do I regret time was too short to\r\nKiss your sweat while we played. \\r\\nBorn prematurely old\r\nI was called out to war;  Vanity was not my cause  Nor the cause of my Requiem.

(683, 1, '2016-10-26 12:46:26', '2016-10-26 20:46:26', 'I watched my mother, once, holding a corpse the size of a honey baked ham. Late evening. Corner of our old street. From my seat on a cloud I recognized its form; watched its tissues dissolve like blood sausage on her just-manicured nails; the spoils of its bloody clots lingering over her lacquered loveliness. Eyes dry. Cheeks sucked in, she buffed her nails, turned on heels that hurt the pavement as the ignoble puddle sizzled, frothed, burped and then congealed into her story.\\r\\nThis, of course, is a dream. But most of my ghost stories, which are often nightmares, occur inside my head. I’ve never been afraid of the real ghosts because they are shy and scurry away as soon as they’ve been spotted.  But they remain lodged inside our heads and make their pre-Broadway appearance night after night in our skulls. That’s what dreams are—ghosts playing hide and seek inside those craniums. \\r\\nTake this other one. It won’t leave me at all. The best way I could describe it would be like this:\\r\\nEarly one evening, six naked men, calmly observed by 36 six onlookers in the children’s section of Central Park wrestled a white pit bull with blue eyes and blond lashes. Why they were naked and why one of them seemed more to be humping the dog’s belly only God knows. Drawn by the moans of the comatose canine, each man pried its mouth open and took his turn looking down the throat of the shivering creature. One man reported he saw shreds of a mongrel the dog had eaten and said that that was what the world was turning into; nations full of mongrels. Another said he saw a lot of pink that looked like the inside of his wife’s vagina and that he’d never love a woman again. Another got up off his dusty ass and said he’d decline to look. If a similar fate awaited him he’d rather die.\\r\\nHe walked towards a little girl, reported to be about five, whose mother said: “Here Mister, take my baby.”\\r\\nTenderly, he removed her yellow satin frock, silver shoes and hand in hand into bushes behind the swings they walked. All 36 onlookers heard the girl moan and the man scream in agony. He was found dead. \\r\\nGlorious day it was when yet another pried the stiffening creature’s dentures so wide he buried his head deep inside its mouth and then, just then:\\r\\nBig Doggy, his face a bloody red mess, snapped its jaws tight and stood on his hind legs.\\r\\nEveryone heard the wrestler’s neck snap but was more hypnotized by his erect cock.\\r\\nGood Doggy thrust his head back and the man’s waist turned a Calypso twist.\\r\\nThis brought wild applause and thus began the carnival in Central Park that is still going on.\r\n \r\nThis is an apocalyptic dream that portends disaster and the breakdown of all boundaries that keep me, perhaps, alienated from my own animality. But it scares me. A loincloth separates me and the dog. It represents untamed vitality--the Life Force. I can’t go there. I won’t go there. The Super-ego is huge. I sense my late grandmother’s presence. I can only watch.\\r\\nThen\\r\\nI have no children. But a ghost who is a little boy is with me. He is 7 years old, the dawn of moral consciousness in Catholicism. He says that the aftermath of God’s Uteral Prolapse was not Genesis after all. He says he dreamed that that Garden was the imagined Uterus God willed to grow outside of him.\\r\\n“Daddy”, he murmurs in his sleep, “at five hundred inches, there’s only so much a waist can grow. Genesis is yet to come.” As the 747 climbs through the billowy baby blues and soft cotton coils, my sweet little boy swears he sees in-Vitro wackos holding fish bowls under some squatting silhouette.\\r\\nOh, my Lord, it is a bloody heave weighing in at two hundred pounds—all glorious fat fried to a crisp at the edges. I make the sign of the cross, remind him that we are 34,000 feet above safety, and order three Bloody Marys. I think we’ll do down. I think we’ll never come back up. When I look, my ghost boy has gone. A diaphanous satin sheet hangs from the window of the aircraft. I cannot see the future. I cannot see my destiny. I scream and scream and when I pull the sheet he is there—grotesque, monstrous, and suspended in mid air, clawing at the face of God.\\r\\n<em>Jason D Hill was born and raised in Jamaica.

Alcohol and nicotine pulsing through my brain, and I want to go home. I wonder if anyone''s ever overdosed on nicotine. It seems unlikely but not impossible. I''ve been sitting on this curb for 3 hours, trying to sober up, and I want to go home. People still shuffling in and out of the house from where I''d just come, still trying to reach the mystical plateau. That tiny cliff at that top of the giant hill that is just enough but not too much. Everyone chasing the light while hanging out in the dark. Everyone on the same fabled conquest of substance; trying to get it without letting it get you. Isn''t it funny that we all go out and push, push, push to get to the point that I''m at now, and then all we want is to go back down, walk backwards down that hill so we can get back to the familiar?\\r\\nI vaguely remember calling a taxi a few hours ago but hadn''t been able to convince myself that it was time to go, it was time to stop doing shots, time to quit doing lines in the bathroom; but I''d missed my chance. I''d probably missed my only chance to get back to the only place I wanted to be right now. Safe and warm, curled up on my bathroom floor. I hear car doors opening and closing. I hear engines starting. Why am I not friends with those people and why am I not leaving with them? Lying down might be a good idea, the spins have taken hold and mixed with the taste of what must have been 100 cigarettes and whatever I''d been drinking in there, it all begins to blur. \\r\\nWe all tell ourselves while we''re punishing our bodies to free our minds that it''ll be a good story, it''ll be something that will make our friends laugh, regardless of how awful the things we did were to get it. Right now, I don''t give a fuck about my friends or what they''re going to say when I tell them about how awful I feel. I don''t give a fuck because I can''t; I''m focused too hard on not freezing to death. I start to think about the snow on my back, and the cold burning feeling on my skin. If the snow was still melting on my skin, I must be alright. The house behind me is still full of people. I wonder if they''re ever going to stop. The sun will come up soon. It has to. I wonder if that''s the signal everyone inside is waiting for. The sun is up, we have to leave now. \\r\\nI sit up because my back is soaking wet. The cold had felt good when I first laid down in it, now it was just another reason I needed to leave. I try to stand but decide it''s a bad idea and sit back down. My ass feeling like it was separated from it''s long lost twin and then reunited. Inside may have been the better option. Thinking about it now I don''t know why I came out here. Did I think that if I just came out and sat down that somehow, through some sort of magic, someone would come and take me home? \\r\\nI can''t breathe all that well through my nose, it''s gotten worse as the night has worn on. The lines I''d done with that girl in the bathroom weren''t helping my current situation. She''d led me in there holding my hand. I thought I was going to get laid. The reality of the situation was completely different. At the time it had all been about pushing the limits, I was fine then. Barely drunk. What''s better than a pick me up? What I know now is that it wasn''t a pick me up. It wasn''t what I had thought it was at all. I ended up doing a small line of Oxycontin on the bathroom counter. This doesn''t mix well with the amount of booze I had been drinking. I knew this wasn''t the best way to keep the party going, but I couldn''t help myself. Oh what I''d do to go back in time. My legs feel heavy, and I want to go home. My ass is numb, and I want to go home.\\r\\nThe house is surrounded by tall pines in all directions. I know this because when I wandered out to piss earlier I''d almost gotten lost on my way back in. It''s funny the details that don''t transfer over from sober to inebriated. I walked up the front steps and noticed the tall pines and hell, I''d even driven through them on my way up here. I mention this up because I''ve already thought about just walking out of here, but I''m almost positive I''ll end up as one of those people you laugh at on the news who is found 50 feet from a highway frozen at the bottom of a tree. My subconscious is trying to kill me, and I want to go home. I feel disconnected from everything, and I want to go home. The sky over the mountains is turning purple, cold darkness is giving way to light. The sun is making it''s way west. The lights on the fronts of the houses are fading, no longer the only thing providing light in the infinite darkness that is this night. I feel my stomach beginning to figure out that it''s only sifting through different types of alcohol and maybe some jell-o from those terrible jell-o shots. I''m almost certain that it''s getting ready to break free of me and find a better owner. Someone who takes care of it.\\r\\nIt seems like things have gotten quiet. I can barely hear the music inside. I was almost positive that someone would call the cops and I''d be waking up tomorrow in some county jail with ten other drunks standing around waiting to be released back into the wild. I''d almost welcome it right now. A night in the drunk tank for the ability to still feel my fingers. I want to stand up. I want to go back inside. I know I could at least find a small corner somewhere to lay down and just sleep all this off. I am soaked to the bone, the curb I''m sitting on isn''t getting any softer, and I want to go home. I can barely feel my legs anymore and my only thoughts are about my bed and how warm my house must be, and I want to go home. \\r\\nThere''s no sound now. There is nothing I can see moving around me. I feel my eyelids begin to feel heavy. I want to sleep. I want to just sleep it off. I''ll wake up in a couple hours and be sober enough to get home. I''ll be sober enough to be able to know where I am. I just... want... to.... sleep. \\r\\n<em>Tyson Perry blogs his short stories at <a href=\"http://tysonshorts.blogspot.com/\">tysonshorts.blogspot.com</a></em>', 'Untitled by Tyson Perry', 0, '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '117-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-10-26 12:51:45', '2016-10-26 20:51:45', '', 117, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/117-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(696, 1, '2016-10-26 12:59:25', '2016-10-26 20:59:25', 'The blizzard commenced in earnest sometime between the appetizer and desert.  My wife and I emerged into a snow-globe world where the flakes came down in clots as large as rabbit tails.   The fresh snow erased the imperfections in a still-transforming area of the south Loop, painting the cracked sidewalks and vacant lots with a coat of temporary innocence.\\r\\n     We leaned together in a human teepee for support, Jill because she was wearing high-heel boots and was five months pregnant and me because of the bottle of wine.  Jill had wet her lips with the Zinfandel to toast our anniversary and I had felt compelled to finish the remaining four and a half glasses before the check.  The result was that I was less help to her than she was to me.\\r\\n     As we inched toward our car on Wells Street, a man staggered into the street waving his arms and jacket at a passing sedan.  The car braked, fish-tailed in the slush and then accelerated, missing the man by the width of its rear view mirror.  The man yelled unintelligibly, as the tail lights dissolved into the cataract of the storm.   \\r\\n     “Is he coming over here?”  Jill’s fingers dug through my coat into the flesh of my forearm, as if the added pressure could transfer her welling anxiety to me.\\r\\n     “Of course,” I said, meaning to be funny.  (I’m told I find myself quite hilarious when imbibing.)\\r\\n     A few seconds later, the man’s stumbling trajectory converged with ours. \\r\\n     “Please help me.  It hurts.  Help me.  My head,” His stained winter coat was off, pressed to the right side of his scalp.  “Look. It hurts.  My head,”\\r\\n     He pulled the jacket away from his bald skull to reveal a deep two inch gash, which seemed in no hurry to stop bleeding.  Blood had darkened the side of his jacket, his sweatshirt, his jeans.  A drop fell into the crust of fresh snow and radiated outward, as if the flakes wished to share their gory find.    \\r\\n     Honestly, I didn’t want to help.  My first thought was for my wife’s safety and to a lesser degree my own.  The man seemed erratic, the wound more likely the result a blow than a fall.  And even if he proved injured but harmless, I had my wife shivering next to me and a bottle of California’s finest clouding my judgment.  Did I have to get involved?    \\r\\n     Valet #1 came trotting down the block, perhaps in aid to an obvious scene of distress.  Valet #1 slowed, as my wife asked him to return to the restaurant for help, and then continued toward the lot, as if the question had been in Aramaic.  Valets #2 and #3 feigned deafness as they passed. \\r\\n     I dialed 911, while arguing with my wife to return to the car.  All the while, the injured man kept us current with an on-going, fragmented account of his pain.  It was too late to walk away.\\r\\n     I summed up the situation for the emergency operator, still pleading with my wife via facial contortions and hand gestures.  I provided our location.  I attempted to answer the dispatcher’s clarifying questions.\\r\\n     “I don’t know if he’s been drinking or on drugs.”  I told the dispatcher.\\r\\n     “I’M NOT ON DRUGS!”  The injured man’s scream was loud enough to freeze the valets in their tracks and the breath in my throat.  The operator did not need me to repeat his answer.\\r\\n     I hung up, my hands shaking from more than cold.  With additional begging, my wife finally relented and went to warm up the car, where she promised to keep watch.  I promised I would be fine.\\r\\n     Still agitated, the man tried to walk away.  Repeatedly, I gently led him back to the tree where we’d first met.  I tried to calm him as best I could.  \\r\\n     “Keep the pressure on, it’s okay, help is coming, don’t sit down, you’re going to be okay.”  \\r\\nBut really I was thinking how lucky I was.  In ten minutes my end of the ordeal would be over, the wounded man’s still in progress and uncertain.  He may or not have been homeless, but was surely somewhere on the left of prosperity’s Bell Curve.  Even after the ambulance came, even if he received prompt medical attention, how ‘okay’ would things really be for him?  \\r\\nThe fire truck created its own slow motion effect, as it closed tentatively along the still unplowed street.  The siren grew with the intensity of the reflected light. Then the alarm cut silent, leaving only the revolving red strobe to mark area of emergency.\\r\\nAs the first firefighter leapt from the truck, I began to guide the injured man.  Before I could take a second step, the three valets swept past me like a pack of black-jacketed Dalmatians.  They yelped and hopped around the firemen, suddenly too helpful, seeking some imaginary scrap of credit that was somehow infinitely more important to them than to me.\\r\\n     An ambulance arrived and a scrambling paramedic came bearing gear.  He threw a blanket over the injured man’s shoulders. I knew then I could no longer add anything to the situation.  \\r\\n     I stepped outside the radius of the flashing lights.  At that moment, I was no longer an active player, not even a spectator.  I was miles from being a hero, and in fact did little more than the bare minimum, what anyone would reasonably expect if they were in similar peril.  And yet how many had ignored him before my wife and I stopped?  How many more would have passed if we didn’t?\\r\\nI climbed inside our climate controlled car and swept flakes from my lashes and brow.  My wife had questions, but I needed a moment to process.  She pulled into the street, past the resolving spectacle, and we disappeared into the whiteout, as anonymous as the man we almost didn’t help.\\r\\n<em>Randy Kohl has also been published in Pology Magazine, Kaleidoscopic Resonance and Perigee: publication for the arts.</em>', 'The I of the Storm by Randy Kohl', 0, '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '159-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-10-26 12:59:25', '2016-10-26 20:59:25', '', 159, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/159-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

She flashed a smile and corrected an errant strand of dark brown hair.\\r\\n\"Not long enough,\" She answered, \" I''m sure you''ve heard that before.\" \\r\\n\"Many times,\" I agreed.

The N333 is sat in the bay as he approaches, indicators flashing and doors closing as it goes to pull away. Rory hammers with the side of his fist on the damp red flank of the bus and, luckily, the driver pauses to let him on.\\r\\nIt is the older style of bus; the fabric on the seats is orange, shot through with geometrical shapes in a mustard yellow. The paint on the hold bar flecks off in his palm as he grabs the pole to steady himself as the bus jerks into the stream of traffic.  They always bring out the old fleet of buses for this nothing period of the night, where the only people likely to be traveling are too drunk or too tired to care about the damp smell and abrasive seating.\\r\\nRory swings off the hold bar into a seat towards the back, where he can feel the rumbling of the left rear wheel under his feet. He is just settling himself, wedging his knees against the seat in front, when the bus eases into its next stop and a girl gets on.\\r\\nShe presses her Oystercard holder to the reader and then twists to slip it into her handbag as she moves down the aisle of the bus. He cannot see her face, but her hair is straight and blonde, her figure trim in a short black jacket and jeans. Her fingers are long and thin, pianist fingers, with chipped pale pink nail varnish. She tosses her damp hair over her shoulder as she swings her bag into a seat, and slides in after it.\\r\\nThree rows ahead of him, she is hyper-real, each strand of hair haloed as the fluorescent tube bulb overhead picks up the droplets of rain clinging there. She fidgets - can she sense his eyes upon her? – and pulls her phone from her bag. The screen lights up as she flips the phone open and closed. No messages. She tosses her phone back into her bag and turns to face the window.\\r\\nHer face thrown back by the dark window is what Rory expected; she is pale and strong featured. The rain on the outside of the glass gouges across the reflection of her face in streaks as the bus hits a straight road and moves up a gear. The two sit in silence as the bus trundles on through sleeping London. If she does sense his attention, she makes no sign of it.\\r\\nThe bus slows once more, but passes the next stop without pausing when the driver sees no passengers waiting there. The blonde girl pulls her phone from her bag again, distractedly. No messages. Who was she expecting a text from at this time of night, Rory wonders.\\r\\nAnother stop, this time to let off a passenger who had been sitting on the upstairs deck. The drunken woman lurches off into the night, and the driver hesitates at his wheel as he peers into the darkness after her, willing her home safely. The blonde girl shifts restlessly in her seat; she is eager to get home herself and there are only a few stops left to travel.\\r\\nSlowly, slowly, the bus pulls away onto the road again. It is the darkest point of the night; moon and stars have set, but there is yet to be even the slightest chink of light in the eastern sky. The streetlights cast the world as orange and dull, reflecting hazily off of the wet humps of parked cars. The bus headlights shine straight, illuminating the rear of the night bus ahead.\\r\\nThe penultimate stop; the driver slows and carries on past when he sees that it too is empty. Rory knows that time is short now, minutes only. But he does nothing but watch the blonde girl as she checks her phone for a third time, and, once again, is disappointed. She places it back into her bag and zips it up.\\r\\nPreparing for the short walk ahead of her, the girl pulls her hair back and rotates her shoulders as she inches towards the edge of her seat. A quick dash through the rain and she would be home; it had been a long day. Rory too, is preparing himself for leaving the close shelter of the bus, for braving the dark and the rain awaiting outside.\\r\\nThis bus terminates here. The blonde girl stands before the bus comes to a stop, clutching the pole by the exit doors as she adjusts the weight of her handbag on her shoulder. The doors slide open with a hiss and the blonde girl hops down. He hears the loose tarmac of the bus bay crunch under her feet as she lands somewhere in the darkness beyond the doors.\\r\\nHe is mere seconds behind her, but he knows now that however quickly he follows her, she is always gone by the time he reaches the doors. He is left with nothing but the shadows in the bus station. Behind him the bus gives a shudder and the lights die. The driver, shift half over, hops down from the front entrance. Giving Rory a perfunctory nod, collar up against the rain, he stalks off in search of a warm drink in a polystyrene cup to see him through till dawn.\\r\\nRory’s feet are aching again. He turns down a cobbled mews road, the shortcut home, out of habit more than anything. It only saves about three minutes. He stops suddenly; the streetlights refracting over the tops of the buildings are playing tricks on him, conjuring up the light of a pale face, of blonde hair tossed over a shoulder. She stalks ahead of him, leading the way home; surely it is just the pattering of the rain that is drowning out her heels clicking against the cobbles?\\r\\nFor the sake of three minutes; for the sake of an empty purse – Emma never trusted herself with cash; for the sake of a few extra hours sleep on his part, she was left like a rag doll there in these narrow mews, the blood soaked deep into the darkness of her jacket but oh so red against the paleness of her skin, of her hair, of the suede bag she clutched so fiercely to her chest, even in death.\\r\\nRory walks on, following the lights. He always picked her up from the bus station after she finished a night shift, but that night he had been irritable, tired. He’d needed the sleep. And so now, that sleep denies him is a justice that he welcomes. And so night after night he walks the rainy streets, following the sheen of her hair in the dark.\\r\\n<em>Erin''s work is collected in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ZCR0M8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B006ZCR0M8&linkCode=as2&tag=backhandstori-20\">\"The Last Train Home\", now available on Amazon.com</a></em>', 'The Night Bus by Erin Lawless', 0, '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '185-revision-v1', '', '', '2012-09-10 13:02:13', '2012-09-10 21:02:13', '', 185, 'http://www.backhandstories.com/fiction/185-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

He also knows I know he’s stalling, I got three of his fingers broke already. And I know this guy ain’t gonna roll over. He’s in a lose-lose. He gives up to me, Valantropo buries him.

And he says, ‘Well? don’t you get it?’”\n\n“Get what?”\n\n “That’s what I said. ‘Get what?’” Scalisi drank deeply.\n\n“Well?”\n\n“What’s in a name.”\n\n “What’s in a name?”\n\n “That''s what he says. ‘Same thing, whatsyou call it. But giving it so many names, makes a thing bigger than it is.’ See? Philosophizing, this guy. Says Americans got more fucking names for dicks than Eskimos got for snow.”\n\n“Huh.”\n\n“Yeah. And he asks me I think that means something about American Society? Lotsa dicks walking the streets, he means maybe. Least how I take it. Then he asks me, he says, I- me we’re talking about- he says I must feel pretty fucking special cause I got more names for me than the Eskimos got for snow and they’re buried in the shit.”\n\n“Meaning what exactly?”\n\n “Meaning he’s calling me a dick. Fancy-like.”\n\n Scalisi gave Morelli a few seconds for it to settle in.\n\n“That’s pretty good,” Morelli said.\n\n“Yeah, pretty good. I thought so.”\n\n “Whachyou do?”\n\n “Eh.

Maybe I should''ve. Or maybe it was the obvious. Maybe it was because she looked at me or my guys as a part of her tribe, just another bunch a crazy fuck-ups, like her that just so happened to have some medical training. Maybe she thought she wouldn''t be judged or looked down upon as much as say some south side \"white bread\" M.D. Who knows. Either way she didn''t seem to mind the dogs barking.\\r\\nTruth was she wasn''t like us at all. She wasn''t really a fuck up. Far from it. She didn''t talk much about herself but she did allude to being an attorney at one point. She was well spoken and had nice teeth and an ever so slight northern dialect that brought back memories of home. She came to us in septic shock and on the verge of death. She almost died on my large breed exam table. Her request was simple. She wanted the hurting to stop but the dying to continue. I told her it didn''t quite work that way. I told her we''d be happy to try to take the edge off of her pain but we really weren''t set up for hospice. There''s no such thing as hospice for dogs or cats. To make her feel better we had to fix her. I finally got her blood pressure up and in check but she still was in real bad shape. This was gonna take some time. I suppose I talked her out of calling it quits at least a little. After all she was a pretty little thing and the world can never have too many pretty faces. \\r\\nWhen I first began removing it, I thought I was going to have to sedate her because she was crying so much. I had to remove the rotting flesh of a small, roasted chicken that she had put up inside of her just a couple a weeks after the delivery of her daughter, Julie, a stillborn. The smell was unbearable and reminiscent of week old decaying road kill on August asphalt. She demanded, against my wishes, to have some time with the chicken. I swaddled the two halves of the bird and put it in her arms. She held it and hugged it tightly and rocked it in this firm embrace and cried for a good forty-five minutes and I’ll tell you this about that girl''s crying,… it sent shivers down my spine. It''s the kind stuff that''s scary enough to scare away your scariest nightmares. All I can say is thank God for those two, recently spaded hound dog sisters that howled against her cries. They did a swell job of drowning out most of it.  I was a medic in Vietnam. Now this isn''t me bragging or trying to toot my own horn. Just because I was one of the many drafted teens running all over the jungle with a bag of gauze, that didn''t for a second make me out as some bad ass soldier boy. Far from it. But what it did mean was that I knew what it was like to be ran through a certifiable shit and misery cycle, one that had been stuck on repeat for a good couple of years. I''ve seen the type a misery and pain that makes the sight of stone cold death seem like a truly beautiful thing, a holy thing. But I swear to God, the way that woman sounded when she was wailing about, while rocking that swaddled up rotten chicken, it was like the moaning sounds of agony coming from hell. I''ll never forget it but I sure wish I could.\\r\\nAfter that horror show was over and done with, we discreetly purged little Ms. 1 lbs six ounces of rotten bird and thoroughly flushed her vaginal cavity and treated her the best we could. We began an aggressive antibiotic therapy both intravenously and by packing.\\r\\nApparently, this woman knew about us because she was the favorite niece or cousin or whatever of some friend of a friend of my boss’ best friend and main colleague. So we knew money wasn''t the lady’s issue. Making her survive was the issue and it was going to take some creativity on my part. Adding the unneeded stress of my boss Roger and his annoying little hatchlings breathing right over my shoulder didn''t make it any easier to work.  \\r\\nFunny thing about serious, systemic infections is that it''s a toss up. Sure, age and prior health all play a part but really, it''s just ends up depending on how the body reacts to the treatment. Will her kidneys hold up? Can we control her fever? When should we be considering dialysis? Can we get her to heal? The big problem was gettin her to want to survive. I don''t think she set out to commit suicide. I just think her dyin was an added bonus. I''ve always believed healing was just as much mental as it was physical but she needed sleep, and food and most of all, hope. She was in pain, immense emotional pain that all my little opiods and their fake friends couldn''t seems to touch at all, and with her blood pressure the way it was, I shouldn''t have really given her the amount of meds I gave her. The heart break was crushing her and it was gonna end up killing her. She just wasn''t gonna allow herself to get better without her baby.\\r\\nBut even though she seemed to be on this fatalistic path, she was, by know means, an introvert. She talked. A lot. She talked my ears off. She wore her feelings on her sleeve and I listened. To sum it up she basically had never finished mourning her loss. The doctors handing her that dead baby just didn''t do it for her. That lifeless child, as much as she loved that lifeless shell and as much as she held and kissed and rocked that lifeless shell, it just, still, was just a shell. It wasn''t her daughter, not the daughter that she knew, or got to know, or got to feel. Julie to her, the real Julie, the only real Julie she felt she knew, wasn''t the dead child she held her arms. \\r\\nInstead, it was Utero Julie, that was her Julie. That was her daughter; the Julie that she never held alive, but would rock to sleep by rocking herself. The Julie that she may have never seen alive but felt alive, always kicking away. The Julie that loved Tex-Mex cause that''s what she craved all the time when she was pregnant. Not Mexican, mind you, but specifically Tex-Mex. The Julie that was a devout night owl that wouldn''t even begin to start stirring around until after Letterman, and then wouldn''t quit until somewhere in the wee early witching hours. The Julie that had the propensity for hiccups in the afternoons, and the Julie that she seemed to be athletic and strong because she kicked low and hard as if she was trying to kick open her cervix and get out. The Julie that was excited about life, and ready to get started. Maybe she wanted to go back and talk to that Julie, to put her hands on her belly while she was alive and well and kicking against her palm, and be able to tell her precious daughter that it was ok to leave if she wanted, that it was ok to go if she felt like she had to.\\r\\nI don''t know really. I’m not a psychologist. Hell, I''m not even a doctor, at least not the kind you’re thinking, but I really wanted to get this right. I wanted to save this woman, I wanted to score some points with the boss man cause I''d been in the hole for points lately. And I did genuinely like her. It wasn''t everyday that I got to  talk someone that seemed as messed up in the head as me. So I got this idea, but I didn''t know yet exactly how I was gonna go about it.\\r\\nFirst, we experimented. We tried several tools but they felt cold and/or too hard, too mechanical and inorganic in movement but she was patient and she could see I was trying. Eventually we both decided that I would use my hand. I would lube up heavily, and while donning the thinnest latex glove that I could possibly find I''d slowly work my whole hand inside of her and move up close to her cervix where I''d begin closing my hand and making a tight, trembling fist before opening it back up. I''d then push up close to her cervix and make firm, un-rhythmic pokes with my fingers, doing the best I could to simulate Julie''s once firm little kicks. Now, even though I wasn''t in her uterus and that \"the baby\" was essentially kickin’ on the wrong side of the door, to momma, it was enough. A lot of things could have gone wrong with this amateur psych maneuver. What if it hurt her? Even though she was still stretched from the birth it was still a possibility. What if it seemed sexual? What if it made it worse?  But I knew I was onto something when, the first time we tried it she just began looking at me with tears rolling down her face, her bottom lip quivering. And that was just the beginning, just a test. After that I went all out. \\r\\nFirst I''d get Nam or Missy to run up and get us some Tex-Mex and fill ol'' momma to the brim with some good ol'' fashion, grease loaded, shitty Texas infused, crappican . We''d eat, and try to get her to laugh and then I''d give her a little something to get her sleepy and she''d lay her head down and burp Tex mex. I would then perform my medically prescribed fisting every night. Upon her request I put headphones on and turned up my Walkman and listened to classical while reading BOW HUNTER magazine. Turning the pages with one hand was difficult but Missy helped when she was there.\\r\\n\"Doin great, Doc.\" Missy’d tell me with a grin while shakin’ her head and walking away.\\r\\nThe woman wanted privacy. She got that, I suppose. I mean how much privacy can you say you want to a man that''s already inside of you?  Sometimes I''d swear I heard the faint crying sounds of a woman in the distant background of Beethoven''s Opus 36 in D major or perhaps a bit of Mozart, preferably any works in the Salzburg-era. Sometimes I''d feel the pressure of an exterior hand rubbing the belly. It never took me more than twenty or thirty minutes and she''d be asleep, out like a light. Twenty minutes soon turned to fifteen, then ten, then five. \\r\\nOne night I walked in. She was sleeping and she looked well. So much so it was as if she was morphing into this incredibly beautiful woman. I just stood there and looked at her while tossing my latex gloves on my shoulder. She opened her lovely eyes and just looked at me. She didn''t say anything. There was just the faintest of a smile. I gave her one right back. She closed her eyes and I left and threw the glove in the trash.\\r\\n<em>W.A Coleman is a Freelance writer based ‎out of Tulsa, Ok.

Unlike most of the people that came to us because they had no choice, she did and yet she still came. As for why, well, I really couldn''t tell you why, and at the time I never thought to ask her. Maybe I should''ve. Or maybe it was the obvious. Maybe it was because she looked at me or my guys as a part of her tribe, just another bunch a crazy fuck-ups, like her that just so happened to have some medical training. Maybe she thought she wouldn''t be judged or looked down upon as much as say some south side \"white bread\" M.D. Who knows. Either way she didn''t seem to mind the dogs barking.\\r\\nTruth was she wasn''t like us at all. She wasn''t really a fuck up. Far from it. She didn''t talk much about herself but she did allude to being an attorney at one point. She was well spoken and had nice teeth and an ever so slight northern dialect that brought back memories of home. She came to us in septic shock and on the verge of death. She almost died on my large breed exam table. Her request was simple. She wanted the hurting to stop but the dying to continue. I told her it didn''t quite work that way. I told her we''d be happy to try to take the edge off of her pain but we really weren''t set up for hospice. There''s no such thing as hospice for dogs or cats. To make her feel better we had to fix her. I finally got her blood pressure up and in check but she still was in real bad shape. This was gonna take some time. I suppose I talked her out of calling it quits at least a little. After all she was a pretty little thing and the world can never have too many pretty faces. \\r\\nWhen I first began removing it, I thought I was going to have to sedate her because she was crying so much. I had to remove the rotting flesh of a small, roasted chicken that she had put up inside of her just a couple a weeks after the delivery of her daughter, Julie, a stillborn. The smell was unbearable and reminiscent of week old decaying road kill on August asphalt. She demanded, against my wishes, to have some time with the chicken. I swaddled the two halves of the bird and put it in her arms. She held it and hugged it tightly and rocked it in this firm embrace and cried for a good forty-five minutes and I’ll tell you this about that girl''s crying,… it sent shivers down my spine. It''s the kind stuff that''s scary enough to scare away your scariest nightmares. All I can say is thank God for those two, recently spaded hound dog sisters that howled against her cries. They did a swell job of drowning out most of it.  I was a medic in Vietnam. Now this isn''t me bragging or trying to toot my own horn. Just because I was one of the many drafted teens running all over the jungle with a bag of gauze, that didn''t for a second make me out as some bad ass soldier boy. Far from it. But what it did mean was that I knew what it was like to be ran through a certifiable shit and misery cycle, one that had been stuck on repeat for a good couple of years. I''ve seen the type a misery and pain that makes the sight of stone cold death seem like a truly beautiful thing, a holy thing. But I swear to God, the way that woman sounded when she was wailing about, while rocking that swaddled up rotten chicken, it was like the moaning sounds of agony coming from hell. I''ll never forget it but I sure wish I could.\\r\\nAfter that horror show was over and done with, we discreetly purged little Ms. 1 lbs six ounces of rotten bird and thoroughly flushed her vaginal cavity and treated her the best we could. We began an aggressive antibiotic therapy both intravenously and by packing.\\r\\nApparently, this woman knew about us because she was the favorite niece or cousin or whatever of some friend of a friend of my boss’ best friend and main colleague. So we knew money wasn''t the lady’s issue. Making her survive was the issue and it was going to take some creativity on my part. Adding the unneeded stress of my boss Roger and his annoying little hatchlings breathing right over my shoulder didn''t make it any easier to work.  \\r\\nFunny thing about serious, systemic infections is that it''s a toss up. Sure, age and prior health all play a part but really, it''s just ends up depending on how the body reacts to the treatment. Will her kidneys hold up? Can we control her fever? When should we be considering dialysis? Can we get her to heal? The big problem was gettin her to want to survive. I don''t think she set out to commit suicide. I just think her dyin was an added bonus. I''ve always believed healing was just as much mental as it was physical but she needed sleep, and food and most of all, hope. She was in pain, immense emotional pain that all my little opiods and their fake friends couldn''t seems to touch at all, and with her blood pressure the way it was, I shouldn''t have really given her the amount of meds I gave her. The heart break was crushing her and it was gonna end up killing her. She just wasn''t gonna allow herself to get better without her baby.\\r\\nBut even though she seemed to be on this fatalistic path, she was, by know means, an introvert. She talked. A lot. She talked my ears off. She wore her feelings on her sleeve and I listened. To sum it up she basically had never finished mourning her loss. The doctors handing her that dead baby just didn''t do it for her. That lifeless child, as much as she loved that lifeless shell and as much as she held and kissed and rocked that lifeless shell, it just, still, was just a shell. It wasn''t her daughter, not the daughter that she knew, or got to know, or got to feel. Julie to her, the real Julie, the only real Julie she felt she knew, wasn''t the dead child she held her arms. \\r\\nInstead, it was Utero Julie, that was her Julie. That was her daughter; the Julie that she never held alive, but would rock to sleep by rocking herself. The Julie that she may have never seen alive but felt alive, always kicking away. The Julie that loved Tex-Mex cause that''s what she craved all the time when she was pregnant. Not Mexican, mind you, but specifically Tex-Mex. The Julie that was a devout night owl that wouldn''t even begin to start stirring around until after Letterman, and then wouldn''t quit until somewhere in the wee early witching hours. The Julie that had the propensity for hiccups in the afternoons, and the Julie that she seemed to be athletic and strong because she kicked low and hard as if she was trying to kick open her cervix and get out. The Julie that was excited about life, and ready to get started. Maybe she wanted to go back and talk to that Julie, to put her hands on her belly while she was alive and well and kicking against her palm, and be able to tell her precious daughter that it was ok to leave if she wanted, that it was ok to go if she felt like she had to.\\r\\nI don''t know really. I’m not a psychologist. Hell, I''m not even a doctor, at least not the kind you’re thinking, but I really wanted to get this right. I wanted to save this woman, I wanted to score some points with the boss man cause I''d been in the hole for points lately. And I did genuinely like her. It wasn''t everyday that I got to  talk someone that seemed as messed up in the head as me. So I got this idea, but I didn''t know yet exactly how I was gonna go about it.\\r\\nFirst, we experimented. We tried several tools but they felt cold and/or too hard, too mechanical and inorganic in movement but she was patient and she could see I was trying. Eventually we both decided that I would use my hand. I would lube up heavily, and while donning the thinnest latex glove that I could possibly find I''d slowly work my whole hand inside of her and move up close to her cervix where I''d begin closing my hand and making a tight, trembling fist before opening it back up. I''d then push up close to her cervix and make firm, un-rhythmic pokes with my fingers, doing the best I could to simulate Julie''s once firm little kicks. Now, even though I wasn''t in her uterus and that \"the baby\" was essentially kickin’ on the wrong side of the door, to momma, it was enough. A lot of things could have gone wrong with this amateur psych maneuver. What if it hurt her? Even though she was still stretched from the birth it was still a possibility. What if it seemed sexual? What if it made it worse?  But I knew I was onto something when, the first time we tried it she just began looking at me with tears rolling down her face, her bottom lip quivering. And that was just the beginning, just a test. After that I went all out. \\r\\nFirst I''d get Nam or Missy to run up and get us some Tex-Mex and fill ol'' momma to the brim with some good ol'' fashion, grease loaded, shitty Texas infused, crappican . We''d eat, and try to get her to laugh and then I''d give her a little something to get her sleepy and she''d lay her head down and burp Tex mex. I would then perform my medically prescribed fisting every night. Upon her request I put headphones on and turned up my Walkman and listened to classical while reading BOW HUNTER magazine. Turning the pages with one hand was difficult but Missy helped when she was there.\\r\\n\"Doin great, Doc.\" Missy’d tell me with a grin while shakin’ her head and walking away.\\r\\nThe woman wanted privacy. She got that, I suppose. I mean how much privacy can you say you want to a man that''s already inside of you?  Sometimes I''d swear I heard the faint crying sounds of a woman in the distant background of Beethoven''s Opus 36 in D major or perhaps a bit of Mozart, preferably any works in the Salzburg-era. Sometimes I''d feel the pressure of an exterior hand rubbing the belly. It never took me more than twenty or thirty minutes and she''d be asleep, out like a light. Twenty minutes soon turned to fifteen, then ten, then five. \\r\\nOne night I walked in. She was sleeping and she looked well.

The idea was that the stories could fit, literally, in your palm. Typically Japanese.</p><p>I, on the other hand, am not Japanese. And I’m far from fragile (but my mum thinks I’m beautiful. I hope.) When I first created this site, I was writing scenes and short stories filled with characters I remember from growing up in the suburbs of Manchester, in the north-west of England. Manchester is generally an industrial city (although I think it has changed some now) and my family were working people. The people I met in the street, in the pubs, in the markets and especially those I came across as I followed my Dad around on his deliveries were more likely to show you the back of their hand (as in, “Any more lip from you son, an'' you’ll see the back o'' me hand...!) than consider the merits of flash fiction crafted by a Japanese Nobel-prize-winning author.</p><p>Most of the scenes I wrote never materialized into anything more substantial – in fact, most of them never materialized into anything at all, as they’re all still floating in the limbo of a corrupted hard drive at the bottom of a cardboard box on my garage floor. However, I did want to create a place for new writers where short fiction was the norm, where writers could grow and learn and where you could read work in a couple of minutes that would stay with you the rest of the day.</p><p>So there you are.
